# Research Results for Criterion:

**Chronic disease prevalence rate (%)**

## Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 13331
- **Data:** Riyadh Region (includes Al Aarid, Riyadh 13331): Chronic disease risk factor and disease prevalence in Saudi adults remains among the highest nationally. National surveys report diabetes prevalence ~18–19% in adults (WHO STEPS KSA 2019; MoH), obesity ~35–38% (higher in central regions including Riyadh), and hypertension ~26–28%. Urban centers such as Riyadh show higher obesity and diabetes burdens versus many peripheral regions. These rates translate to substantial demand for chronic disease management services (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease), especially given Riyadh’s large and growing adult population base.
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Explanation:** Higher chronic disease prevalence in urban Riyadh paired with very large catchment population implies strong and sustained need for hospital-based chronic care (endocrinology, cardiology, renal services). On this single criterion (prevalence), a higher burden indicates greater service demand; therefore Riyadh scores high.

## NEOM, Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** NEOM (Sharma, Tabuk Province): Current resident population is comparatively low, but situated within Tabuk Province, where adult NCD burdens mirror national levels: diabetes roughly ~15–17%, obesity ~30–35%, and hypertension ~24–26% based on national/regional estimates. However, the immediate NEOM/Sharma population is still small; thus absolute numbers of chronic disease cases are lower today despite moderate prevalence. NEOM’s planned growth could increase future chronic disease service demand.
- **Score:** 5/10
- **Explanation:** Estimated chronic disease prevalence is moderate (similar to national averages), but the present population base in NEOM/Sharma remains limited, yielding fewer absolute chronic cases today. On prevalence alone, it is not low, but demand is constrained by scale. Future growth could raise need, but on current prevalence-driven utility, it is mid-range.

## Madinah , Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Madinah Region (includes King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312): Western-region data indicate adult diabetes prevalence ~18–20%, obesity ~33–37%, and hypertension ~25–28%, comparable to or slightly above national averages. Madinah city serves residents and large volumes of visitors/pilgrims who have notable NCD burdens, increasing the real-world load of chronic conditions requiring acute and longitudinal management.
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Explanation:** Chronic disease prevalence is high and comparable to Riyadh, and the city’s role as a religious destination increases the volume of adults with NCDs needing care. On the prevalence criterion, this translates into strong and steady demand for hospital-based chronic disease services.

## Overall Analysis
All three locations have high chronic disease prevalence typical of Saudi Arabia, driven by obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Riyadh and Madinah show the highest anticipated need due to high prevalence combined with large, dense populations—Riyadh slightly higher for hospital placement on this criterion. NEOM/Sharma likely has similar prevalence but a much smaller current population base, reducing immediate chronic case volumes despite future growth potential.

**Annual population growth rate (%)**

## Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 13331
- **Data:** Riyadh (capital and largest city) sits in Riyadh Region, which has been the fastest-growing region in Saudi Arabia. GASTAT’s 2022 demographic survey shows Riyadh Region accounted for ~26% of the Kingdom’s population and is the primary net in‑migration destination. Nationally, GASTAT reported very rapid population growth between 2022 and 2023 (from 32.2m to 34.8m; ~7.9% year-over-year) mainly due to a rebound in expatriate inflows, while Saudi nationals grew ~1.7–2.0% annually. Riyadh city specifically has long exhibited above‑average growth due to internal migration and major economic programs (e.g., Vision 2030, Riyadh metro, mega‑projects), with multiple government announcements targeting the city’s population to reach 15–20 million by 2030–2035 (implying mid‑single‑digit annual growth if realized). While precise city‑level annual growth rates are not published annually by GASTAT, triangulation from recent GASTAT releases and official targets indicates Riyadh’s current effective growth (population present/served, including expatriates) is in the high single digits in 2023 off a migration surge, normalizing toward ~3–4% in the medium term as inflows stabilize.
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Explanation:** High and sustained population growth (driven by migration, economic expansion, and government programs) increases future hospital demand. Even allowing for normalization after the 2023 surge, Riyadh’s medium‑term growth outlook is among the strongest in the Kingdom, supporting a high score on this criterion alone.

## NEOM, Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** NEOM (in Tabuk Province, near Sharma) is a new greenfield development with minimal permanent resident base today. Tabuk Province’s total population is much smaller than Riyadh or Madinah and historically grows at a moderate rate (roughly ~1–2% per year for Saudi nationals, with expatriate fluctuations). NEOM’s official plans target up to 1–9 million residents by 2045–2050 (varies by phase), but current occupancy is primarily project staff/contractors, with phased habitation still ramping. Thus, current realized annual population growth at the site is low in absolute numbers from a very small base, though planned growth is high and volatile, dependent on project phasing and funding.
- **Score:** 5/10
- **Explanation:** Projected growth is very high, but present, verifiable annual population growth at the site is low due to the nascent resident base. For this criterion (actual annual growth), NEOM scores mid‑range: upside exists, but near‑term certainty is lower than established cities.

## Madinah , Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Madinah (Al Madinah Al Munawwarah) is a major Saudi city and pilgrimage hub. GASTAT data show the Madinah Region accounts for roughly 8–9% of the national population. Saudi nationals’ natural increase is steady (~1.5–2% annually), and expatriate inflows have recovered post‑pandemic, lifting overall growth. While not as migration‑driven as Riyadh, Madinah city’s population trend is positive, supported by religious tourism expansion (e.g., post‑pandemic recovery) and urban development plans, implying an overall annual growth rate around ~2–3% in the medium term.
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Madinah exhibits steady, moderate population growth. It lacks Riyadh’s surge from economic in‑migration but maintains consistent demand growth tied to residents and pilgrims. On this criterion, it ranks above a greenfield like NEOM (today) but below Riyadh.

## Overall Analysis
On the specific criterion of annual population growth rate: Riyadh leads due to strong net in‑migration and economic momentum (score 9). Madinah shows solid, steady growth (score 7). NEOM’s long‑term plan suggests high future growth, but current realized growth from a small base is limited and uncertain (score 5). These scores reflect present and medium‑term demographic dynamics affecting hospital demand growth.

**Public transportation accessibility score**

## Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 13331
- **Data:** Address: RRDA4539 King Abdulaziz Road, Al Aarid, Riyadh 13331, Saudi Arabia. Public transport context: Riyadh operates the citywide Riyadh Bus network (launched in phases since March 2023 by the Royal Commission for Riyadh City), which serves major arterials including King Abdulaziz Road in the north of the city; stops are typically spaced for walk-up access along the corridor. The King Abdulaziz Road corridor is also designated for a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line under the King Abdulaziz Public Transport Project (part of Riyadh’s integrated metro + BRT program). The Riyadh Metro (6-line network under the same project) is planned to interconnect with bus/BRT; stations nearest to Al Aarid will be several kilometers to the south when rail service opens, so near-term access relies on buses/BRT. References: Riyadh Bus official info and network updates (https://riyadhbus.sa/en); Royal Commission for Riyadh City – Public Transport Program and BRT/Metro project pages (https://www.rcrc.gov.sa/en/projects/public-transport).
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Strengths: On-corridor service on King Abdulaziz Road via the operational Riyadh Bus network, with planned dedicated BRT on the same corridor, provides relatively good public transport accessibility for staff, patients, and visitors. The corridor is a major north–south spine with frequent service and multiple stop options within walking distance for a site fronting King Abdulaziz Road. Constraints: Citywide rail (metro) access in this northern district is not yet in public operation; the nearest rail nodes are several kilometers away. Pedestrian crossing of wide arterials can add friction to first/last‑mile access. Overall, good present-day bus access with strong upside once BRT/metro phases complete, but not the city’s highest PT accessibility today.

## NEOM, Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Address: 269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM, Saudi Arabia. Public transport context: NEOM/Sharma currently has no municipal public transport network in general public operation (no urban bus or rail). NEOM’s long‑term mobility plan centers on car‑free urbanism and high‑capacity transit (e.g., THE LINE’s spine rail), but these systems are under development and not available for public use yet. Regional connectivity is primarily by road. The nearest airport is NEOM Bay Airport (IATA: NUM) near Sharma; air service is limited and not a substitute for local public transit. Intercity buses (SAPTCO) serve larger regional cities such as Tabuk and Duba; the nearest intercity bus hubs are roughly 90–100 km (Duba) and 160–180 km (Tabuk) by road from Sharma, with no established local feeder transit in NEOM for the general public. References: NEOM mobility concepts and project information (https://www.neom.com); SAPTCO intercity services (https://www.saptco.com.sa).
- **Score:** 1/10
- **Explanation:** The site currently lacks local public transport (no city bus or rail) and relies on private vehicles or project-operated shuttles. Intercity bus and the nearby airport do not provide practical daily access for patients or staff without local feeders. While future NEOM transit is planned, it is not available for near- to medium-term operations. Score reflects very limited present-day public transport accessibility.

## Madinah , Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Address: King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312, Saudi Arabia. Public transport context: Madinah has an urban bus network (“Madinah Buses”/city buses operated under the Transport General Authority and local operators, including SAPTCO) serving principal corridors such as King Abdullah Road with multiple city routes and signed stops. The city is also served by the Haramain High-Speed Railway (Al Madinah Station), which connects Madinah with Jeddah and Makkah; the rail station is located on the eastern side of the city and is approximately 8–10 km by road from the Al Rayah/King Abdullah Rd area, offering strong regional—but not local—public transport connectivity. Local circulator and seasonal shuttle services operate around the central area during peak pilgrimage periods, improving coverage but with variable schedules outside peak seasons. References: SAPTCO city services (https://www.saptco.com.sa); Saudi public transport program information (Transport General Authority: https://tga.gov.sa); Haramain High-Speed Railway information (Saudi Arabia Railways: https://www.sar.com.sa/en).
- **Score:** 5/10
- **Explanation:** Strengths: Established city bus services along King Abdullah Road provide walk-up access to multiple routes; the city benefits from regional rail (Haramain HSR) for intercity trips. Constraints: Bus service levels (frequency/span) vary by route and season; there is no urban rail. First/last‑mile conditions along wide arterials can be a barrier. Overall, moderate public transport accessibility suitable for a hospital with bus-dependent access, but less robust than a site adjacent to a rail/BRT hub.

## Overall Analysis
For public transportation accessibility alone, Location 1 (Riyadh, King Abdulaziz Rd) ranks best due to active city bus service on the corridor today and planned BRT/metro integration, offering good current access and strong future upside. Location 3 (Madinah, King Abdullah Rd) is moderate, with established city buses and regional rail nearby but no urban rail. Location 2 (NEOM/Sharma) scores very low due to the absence of an operational local public transport network at present.

# Research Results for Criterion:

**Zoning compliance score**

## Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 13331
- **Data:** Address: King Abdulaziz Rd, Al Aarid District, Riyadh 13331, Saudi Arabia. Jurisdiction and regulators: Riyadh Municipality under MOMRAH (Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and Housing); citywide planning by the Royal Commission for Riyadh City (RCRC). Corridor context: King Abdulaziz Rd is a primary north–south arterial with established commercial/mixed‑use frontage and residential neighborhoods behind; health and public‑service uses are commonly sited on major corridors in north Riyadh (Al Aarid/Al Malqa/Al Thumama growth belt). Zoning/permissibility: Under MOMRAH municipal use classes and the Municipal Requirements for Healthcare Facilities, hospitals and clinics are permitted on commercial, mixed‑use, and public‑service plots (subject to plot size, setbacks, parking, access from a main road, and Civil Defense and MOH licensing). Utilities/access: Fully urbanized area with trunk utilities and multiple access options; arterial frontage supports ambulance access and traffic dispersion. Known overlays/constraints: No coastal/industrial hazard or protected‑area overlays; outside airport OLS critical zones; flood‑channel considerations are standard for Riyadh but no special overlay is indicated for this corridor. Approvals: Municipal land‑use confirmation via Balady GIS/permit; MOH facility license; Civil Defense; environmental and medical‑waste compliance; traffic impact study if required by RCRC/Riyadh Municipality. Note: Exact plot zoning must be verified on Balady and RCRC parcel data before application.
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Explanation:** High likelihood of compliance for hospital use along a major arterial in a rapidly urbanizing, mixed‑use corridor where health facilities are typically allowed under MOMRAH rules. Primary risks are plot‑specific (current designation/residential status, access geometry, parking supply) rather than area‑wide zoning prohibitions.

## NEOM, Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Address: 269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM, Saudi Arabia (Tabuk Province, Red Sea coast). Jurisdiction and regulators: NEOM Authority (special economic zone) with its own planning, building, and environmental regulations; outside standard municipal regime. Area context: Coastal area within NEOM’s development footprint; land is subject to NEOM masterplans (e.g., designated community hubs, conservation areas, mobility corridors). Zoning/permissibility: Healthcare uses are planned within designated NEOM communities; ad‑hoc siting outside those nodes generally requires explicit NEOM land‑use allocation. Coastal protection and environmental regulations impose setbacks from the shoreline and require environmental impact assessment; sensitive habitats are present along this coast. Utilities/access: Many tracts remain under phased development; service availability and road hierarchy are masterplan‑dependent at this coordinate. Overlays/constraints: Coastal conservation policies, potential archeological/natural heritage constraints, and NEOM design code controls; aviation constraints possible if near NEOM Bay Airport flight paths; helipad approvals subject to GACA. Approvals: NEOM Permits & Licenses (planning consent, building permit), environmental approvals under NEOM Environmental Protection Regulations, MOH license for operation, Civil Defense.
- **Score:** 5/10
- **Explanation:** Regulatory pathway is feasible only if the site lies within a NEOM‑designated service/healthcare zone. Strong environmental/coastal controls and masterplan‑driven land allocation create higher zoning/entitlement uncertainty compared with conventional municipal settings.

## Madinah , Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Address: King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah District, Madinah 42312, Saudi Arabia. Jurisdiction and regulators: Madinah Region Municipality under MOMRAH; regional planning by the Madinah Development Authority. Corridor context: King Abdullah Rd is a major urban arterial/ring corridor with mixed commercial/public‑service frontage in an established urban district. Zoning/permissibility: Hospitals and clinics are permitted municipal activities on commercial, mixed‑use, and public‑service plots per MOMRAH municipal requirements for healthcare facilities, subject to plot size, setbacks, parking, main‑road access, and MOH/Civil Defense approvals. Utilities/access: Urban services are present; arterial access supports ambulance ingress/egress. Overlays/constraints: Central Area around Al‑Masjid an‑Nabawi has height/traffic controls; Al Rayah is outside the immediate Central Area but corridor‑level traffic management and any local height controls may apply. Approvals: Land‑use confirmation via Balady GIS/permit, MOH license, Civil Defense, traffic impact assessment if triggered by scale.
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Generally favorable municipal context for hospital use on a major corridor with established mixed uses. Residual risk stems from plot‑specific designation, corridor traffic/parking standards, and any proximity‑based controls related to the broader Central Area policies.

## Overall Analysis
All three sites can potentially host a hospital, but zoning/entitlement certainty varies. Riyadh (Al Aarid, King Abdulaziz Rd) offers the clearest by‑policy pathway on an arterial commonly hosting public‑service uses (score 8/10). Madinah (King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah) is also favorable, with typical municipal permissions and standard corridor controls (7/10). NEOM (Sharma) is most uncertain because land use is tightly governed by NEOM’s masterplans and coastal/environmental protections; compliance depends on being within a designated healthcare/service node (5/10). In all cases, confirm the specific parcel’s current land‑use designation on Balady (or NEOM’s permitting system) before proceeding.

# Research Results for Criterion:

**Average household income ($)**

## Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 13331
- **Data:** Riyadh (Al Aarid district, 13331). Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Statistics (GASTAT) reports that the average monthly household income in the Riyadh administrative region is among the highest nationally. In the 2018 Household Income and Expenditure Survey, Riyadh’s average monthly household income was reported at approximately SAR 13,400–14,000 per household, higher than most other regions. Using the Saudi riyal’s long‑standing peg (≈ SAR 3.75 = USD 1), this is roughly USD 3,570–3,730 per month (USD ~42,800–44,800 per year). Riyadh also has the country’s highest concentration of high‑income and expatriate professional households, particularly in fast‑growing northern districts like Al Aarid (King Abdulaziz Rd corridor), which typically over-index relative to the region-wide average.
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Explanation:** Within Saudi Arabia, Riyadh has the highest household earning power and payer mix depth, which is favorable for hospital revenue capture (private insurance/self-pay). Northern Riyadh districts such as Al Aarid skew higher than the regional mean, making this location highly attractive on the income criterion alone.

## NEOM, Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** NEOM (Sharma, Tabuk Province). Current household income in NEOM/Sharma is not yet representative of a mature resident market; the area is under phased development. Tabuk region’s average monthly household income (GASTAT 2018) trails Riyadh and Madinah, commonly cited near SAR 10,000–11,500 per month, equating to roughly USD 2,670–3,070 per month (USD ~32,000–36,800 per year) at the SAR 3.75 = USD 1 peg. While NEOM’s future resident profile is planned to be high-income, present-day permanent household base in Sharma/NEOM remains small and mixed (construction/transient workforce).
- **Score:** 6/10
- **Explanation:** On the income criterion today, the broader Tabuk region’s household income is mid-range. NEOM’s long-term plans point to a higher-income population, but current local household income depth is limited, tempering immediate hospital revenue potential.

## Madinah , Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Madinah (Al Rayah, 42312). GASTAT data indicate Madinah region’s average monthly household income sits above many regions but below Riyadh, typically around SAR 11,500–12,500 per month, or roughly USD 3,070–3,330 per month (USD ~36,800–40,000 per year) at SAR 3.75 = USD 1. Madinah’s economy also benefits from religious tourism and service sectors, with mixed-income resident neighborhoods; central and north-central corridors along King Abdullah Rd host middle to upper‑middle income households supporting private healthcare demand.
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Madinah’s household income is solid but generally below Riyadh’s, yielding good—though not top-tier—ability to pay for hospital services. Tourism seasonality and a broad middle-income base support steady demand but with slightly lower revenue intensity than northern Riyadh.

## Overall Analysis
Based solely on average household income, Riyadh (Al Aarid) is strongest, reflecting Saudi Arabia’s highest-earning households and a premium payer mix. Madinah is mid-to-high, supporting viable private hospital economics but below Riyadh’s ceiling. NEOM/Sharma’s current household income base aligns with Tabuk’s mid-range profile; while future NEOM demographics may be high-income, present-day local incomes and resident depth are still developing.

**Physician availability per 1000 people**

## Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 13331
- **Data:** Address is in Riyadh city (Al Aarid), within Riyadh Region — Saudi Arabia’s largest physician labor market and tertiary-care hub. National benchmark: physicians per 1,000 people ≈ 2.7 (World Bank, 2020). Riyadh Region contains the country’s highest concentration of physicians relative to population per Ministry of Health (MoH) Statistical Yearbooks, reflecting the clustering of major academic/tertiary centers (e.g., King Faisal Specialist & Research Centre, King Saud University Medical City, National Guard Health Affairs) and multiple medical colleges that feed the local workforce. Riyadh Region population (2022 Census) ≈ 8.6 million (GASTAT). These factors translate to the strongest practical physician availability in the Kingdom at the city/region level. Sources: World Bank SH.MED.PHYS.ZS (Saudi Arabia); Saudi MoH Statistical Yearbook 2022; GASTAT 2022 Census (Riyadh Region population).
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Explanation:** Riyadh has the deepest, most diverse physician pool and the highest physicians-per-capita profile among Saudi regions, plus robust academic and recruitment pipelines. On the specific criterion (physicians per 1,000), Riyadh scores strongest as a proxy for immediate and scalable staffing.

## NEOM, Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Address is in NEOM (near Sharma) within Tabuk Region (northwest Saudi Arabia). National benchmark: physicians per 1,000 people ≈ 2.7 (World Bank, 2020). Tabuk Region is sparsely populated and more rural; MoH health indicators and yearbooks show lower physician concentration than large metropolitan regions (e.g., Riyadh/Makkah). NEOM’s on‑site resident population remains limited and evolving; current care footprint is developing, with reliance on recruitment from outside the region and referral pathways to Tabuk city or national centers. Tabuk Region population (2022 Census) ≈ 0.9–1.0 million (GASTAT). Sources: World Bank SH.MED.PHYS.ZS; Saudi MoH Statistical Yearbook 2022; GASTAT 2022 Census (Tabuk Region population); publicly available NEOM program materials.
- **Score:** 3/10
- **Explanation:** Local physician availability per 1,000 people is low relative to major regions, and the immediate catchment is small and dispersed. While NEOM plans significant growth, today’s physician density and recruiting depth are limited, making near‑term hospital staffing more challenging.

## Madinah , Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Address is in Madinah city within Madinah Region. National benchmark: physicians per 1,000 people ≈ 2.7 (World Bank, 2020). Madinah hosts major public and teaching hospitals (e.g., King Fahd Hospital, Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz Hospital) and Taibah University College of Medicine, supporting a moderate physician workforce. MoH statistical reports place Madinah around the national average for physician availability, below Riyadh but above several less‑populated regions. Madinah Region population (2022 Census) ≈ 2.3–2.5 million (GASTAT). Sources: World Bank SH.MED.PHYS.ZS; Saudi MoH Statistical Yearbook 2022; GASTAT 2022 Census (Madinah Region population).
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Physician availability per 1,000 is around the national average with established tertiary and academic anchors, providing a workable staffing base. Not as deep as Riyadh but materially stronger than remote/low‑density regions.

## Overall Analysis
City/region‑level physician density is the best available proxy for these specific addresses. Riyadh offers the highest physician availability and recruitment depth; Madinah is moderate and serviceable; NEOM (Tabuk Region) is currently low-density and reliant on external recruitment. Benchmarks and regional context are sourced from Saudi MoH Statistical Yearbooks, GASTAT 2022 Census, and the World Bank physicians‑per‑1,000 indicator for national reference.

**Environmental risk assessment**

## Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 13331
- **Data:** - Setting: Inland urban district (Al Aarid) in northern Riyadh on the Najd plateau; elevation roughly 600–700 m above sea level; arid built-up surroundings with major arterials (King Abdulaziz Rd); King Khalid International Airport is roughly 20–25 km away (potential flight-path noise depending on runway use). - Climate: Hot desert (BWh). National Center for Meteorology (Saudi NCM) normals indicate very hot summers (average July/August max ~43–45°C) and mild winters; low annual rainfall (~90–110 mm), concentrated November–April with episodic convective downpours that can produce flash floods. - Air quality and dust: Frequently degraded by dust/sandstorms driven by shamal winds (most common in spring). Independent monitoring (e.g., IQAir World Air Quality reports) show annual PM2.5 well above WHO guideline (5 µg/m³), commonly exceeding 50 µg/m³ in recent years; multiple dusty days per year (on the order of several dozen) are typical for Riyadh according to regional dust climatology studies. - Flood/flash-flood hazard: Riyadh has a network of wadis (e.g., Wadi Hanifah and tributaries). Urban flash flooding has been documented in heavy-rain events (civil defense/NCM advisories; notable events in 2013 and 2018–2019), with localized roadway and underpass flooding; the Al Aarid area includes engineered stormwater infrastructure but remains exposed to short-duration, high-intensity rainfall. - Seismic/tectonic hazard: Very low compared with western Saudi Arabia. Saudi Geological Survey (SGS) seismic hazard maps classify the Riyadh region in a low peak ground acceleration zone (on the order of <0.04 g for 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years). No tsunami exposure (inland). - Heat stress/urban microclimate: Strong urban heat island, extreme summer heat, and high radiant load increase building cooling and outdoor thermal stress. - Other environmental considerations: No nearby heavy industry clusters in the immediate Al Aarid vicinity; traffic emissions and construction dust are main local contributors; no sea-level rise exposure.
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Strengths: very low seismic hazard and no coastal/tsunami exposure; absence of heavy industry nearby. Main environmental risks are extreme heat, frequent dust/sandstorms with poor PM2.5 air quality, and episodic urban flash flooding from short, intense rain events. With robust building envelope/HVAC filtration, shading, and stormwater design, risks are manageable—hence above-average suitability but not top-tier due to chronic air quality and heat.

## NEOM, Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** - Setting: Coastal site near Sharma in the NEOM development area on the Gulf of Aqaba/Red Sea coast; elevation ~0–50 m on a narrow coastal plain backed by steep mountains and wadis draining to the sea; sensitive marine and coral reef environments offshore. - Climate: Hot arid maritime. Summers are very warm but typically a few degrees milder than interior cities (typical summer highs ~36–40°C) with higher humidity; annual rainfall is very low (~10–40 mm) but can occur in short, intense events, especially in cooler seasons, with orographic enhancement over nearby mountains. - Air quality and dust: Baseline anthropogenic pollution is relatively low compared to major cities; PM2.5 annual means are generally lower (often ~15–35 µg/m³) but still above WHO guideline due to regional dust; episodic dust/sand intrusions occur under northerly shamal and synoptic disturbances. - Flood/flash-flood hazard: Pronounced risk of short-notice flash flooding where wadis debouch from the escarpment across the coastal plain; siting away from active wadi channels and ensuring elevated platforms/drainage conveyance is critical. - Seismic/tectonic and tsunami hazard: Moderate seismic hazard due to proximity to the Gulf of Aqaba–Dead Sea Transform and Red Sea rift. SGS hazard mapping places the far northwest in a higher zone than central Saudi (on the order of ~0.1–0.2 g PGA for 10% in 50 years). The Mw 7.2 Gulf of Aqaba earthquake (1995) generated localized tsunami/wave effects observed around Eilat/Aqaba; while the Red Sea micro-tidal range limits surge, coastal facilities should consider tsunami/storm wave setback and vertical evacuation. - Sea-level rise/coastal flooding: Exposed to long-term sea-level rise and coastal inundation; design freeboards and setbacks are required under mid- to late-century scenarios (IPCC-consistent planning: ~0.5–1.0 m global mean SLR by 2100 under higher emissions, with local variation). - Other environmental considerations: Strong coastal winds; corrosion potential from marine aerosols; proximity to protected marine habitats and wildlife corridors implies more stringent environmental permitting and construction controls.
- **Score:** 6/10
- **Explanation:** Strengths: comparatively cleaner air and slightly milder temperatures than interior sites; good ventilation from coastal winds. Key environmental risks that lower suitability are: moderate seismicity with credible tsunami potential, flash-flooding from steep wadis, and direct coastal exposure to storm waves and sea-level rise. With rigorous seismic/tsunami design criteria, coastal set-back/elevation, and flood routing, risks are manageable but higher than inland low-seismic alternatives.

## Madinah , Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** - Setting: Urban corridor along King Abdullah Rd in Al Rayah, Madinah; inland basin surrounded by volcanic basalt fields (Harrat Rahat) and hills; elevation roughly ~600–650 m. - Climate: Hot desert (BWh). Very hot summers (average July/August max ~43–44°C); low annual rainfall (~30–60 mm) concentrated in cooler months; convective storms can produce intense short-duration rainfall. - Air quality and dust: PM2.5 typically above WHO guideline but generally lower than Riyadh’s heavy urban levels (often ~30–50 µg/m³ annually), with episodic dust events. - Flood/flash-flood hazard: Presence of wadis (e.g., Wadi Al-Aqeeq and tributaries) traversing the metropolitan area; recent NCM/civil defense advisories and documented events have produced urban flooding and road closures in heavy rains. - Seismic/tectonic and volcanic hazard: Western Saudi Arabia has higher seismic hazard than the interior; SGS maps place Madinah in a moderate zone (roughly ~0.08–0.16 g PGA for 10% in 50 years) due to proximity to the Red Sea rift and local structures. Madinah is adjacent to the Harrat Rahat volcanic field; the last eruption in 1256 CE produced lava flows that approached the city—implying a low-probability but credible long-term volcanic hazard, along with potential volcanic/seismic swarms. - Other environmental considerations: No tsunami or sea-level rise exposure (inland); airport located to the northeast (potential flight-path noise depending on approach), traffic emissions along the corridor, and pronounced summer heat stress.
- **Score:** 5/10
- **Explanation:** Strengths: no coastal/tsunami exposure; air quality often better than Riyadh. However, environmental risk is elevated by the combination of moderate seismic hazard, a documented (though low-frequency) volcanic field adjacent to the city, and recurrent flash-flooding in wadi corridors, plus extreme heat. These factors collectively lower suitability relative to low-seismic inland alternatives.

## Overall Analysis
For environmental risk alone (natural hazards, climate/air, and site-exposure factors): Riyadh (Al Aarid) ranks highest due to very low seismic risk and no coastal exposure, but its chronic heat/dust/PM2.5 and episodic flash floods keep it from a top score. NEOM (Sharma) benefits from cleaner air and slightly milder heat but faces materially higher seismic/tsunami and coastal/flash-flood exposures that require stringent siting and design. Madinah contends with moderate seismicity, a low-frequency volcanic hazard (Harrat Rahat), and wadi flash-flooding in addition to extreme heat, yielding the lowest score among the three. Robust hazard-aware siting (avoiding wadis/coastal lowlands), conservative structural and flood design, elevated/armored critical infrastructure, and high-spec HVAC filtration are key mitigations across all sites.

# Research Results for Criterion:

**Proximity to major highways (km)**

## Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 13331
- **Data:** Address: King Abdulaziz Rd, Al Aarid, Riyadh 13331. This corridor is a major north–south arterial in northern Riyadh. Nearest grade‑separated expressways: King Salman Rd (a regional ring/expressway) ≈1.0–1.5 km north; Northern Ring Rd (Route 30) ≈6–8 km south; Route 65 (Riyadh–Qassim Expressway/King Fahd Rd) ≈5–7 km west; Airport Expressway (Route 539/King Khalid Rd) ≈7–9 km east. Practical nearest major highway access is via King Salman Rd at ≈1–1.5 km.
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Explanation:** Very close (≈1–1.5 km) to King Salman Rd, providing rapid regional access, and within 5–9 km of several other primary expressways (R65, Northern Ring, Airport Expy). This proximity supports efficient patient, staff, and logistics access with multiple route redundancies. Minor deduction for being on an urban arterial rather than directly frontage to a motorway (potential local congestion).

## NEOM, Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Address: 269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM (Tabuk Province). The Sharma/NEOM coastal zone is served primarily by Highway 5 (Route 5) running along the Red Sea coast. The 269J+WJ Plus Code plots near Sharma; the nearest junction with Highway 5 is approximately 2–4 km (depending on the exact plot within the Plus Code area). Nearest other major routes are far (hundreds of km); Highway 5 is the main regional artery linking to Duba and Haql.
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Proximity to a single major highway (Route 5) is good (≈2–4 km), giving coastal regional access, but redundancy is limited and distances to other expressways/urban rings are very large. Emerging infrastructure in NEOM may improve this, but current network density is low compared with major cities.

## Madinah , Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Address: King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312. King Abdullah Rd is a principal east–west urban expressway in Madinah with grade separations that links directly to Route 60 (Madinah–Yanbu Highway) on the west and Route 15 (Hijrah Rd) to the south/east via interchanges. Distance to Route 60: ≈2–3 km west; distance to Route 15: ≈4–6 km south/east. The corridor itself functions as a major expressway inside the city.
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Explanation:** Located on or immediately adjacent to a city expressway with quick access (≈2–6 km) to two national highways (R60 and R15), offering strong regional connectivity. Slightly less redundancy and scale than northern Riyadh’s multi‑expressway hub, but still very favorable.

## Overall Analysis
All three sites are close to major highways. Riyadh Al Aarid is best, with immediate access (≈1–1.5 km) to King Salman Rd and multiple other expressways within 5–9 km, supporting superior regional connectivity and redundancy. Madinah’s King Abdullah Rd site is also strong, effectively on an urban expressway with short links to R60 and R15. The NEOM/Sharma site is near Highway 5 (≈2–4 km) but lacks alternative major routes, reducing redundancy despite acceptable proximity.

**Natural disaster risk level**

## Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 13331
- **Data:** Riyadh (Al Aarid district, King Abdulaziz Rd, 13331) sits on the Arabian Peninsula's interior plateau, far from active plate boundaries. Key natural-hazard facts:
- Earthquake: Very low seismicity relative to the Kingdom; national and global seismic hazard maps place Riyadh in one of Saudi Arabia’s lowest shaking zones (typical 475-year PGA well below ~0.05 g). [Sources: Saudi Geological Survey (SGS) national seismic hazard mapping; Global Earthquake Model (GEM) seismic hazard mosaic]
- Flood/flash flood: Periodic heavy convective storms can trigger urban/flash flooding along wadis (e.g., events in 2018 and 2023 led to roadway flooding and temporary closures). City is crossed by Wadi Hanifa and tributaries, with known surface-water concentration points. [Sources: Saudi civil defense and media reports; municipal drainage studies]
- Sand/dust storms: Frequent Shamal winds cause dust storms and reduced visibility several times per year; impacts are operational (air quality, power/air intake management) rather than structural. [Sources: WMO/WHO regional dust reports]
- Extreme heat: Prolonged heatwaves are common; summer daytime highs often exceed 45°C, raising cooling and power-reliability design demands. [Sources: Saudi National Center for Meteorology climatology]
- No tsunami or tropical cyclone exposure (inland); no volcanic hazard.
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Explanation:** Riyadh’s structural disaster risk is comparatively low: minimal seismicity and no tsunami/volcanic/cyclone exposure. Residual risks are mainly flash flooding, extreme heat, and dust, which can be mitigated through siting (away from wadis), robust drainage, cooling and filtration redundancy, and emergency power design. These manageable hazards keep the score high but not perfect.

## NEOM, Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** NEOM/Sharma area (269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, Tabuk Region) lies on the Red Sea/Gulf of Aqaba coast near the Dead Sea Transform and Gulf of Aqaba rift system. Key natural-hazard facts:
- Earthquake: Elevated seismic hazard for Saudi Arabia due to proximity to active faults; the 1995 Gulf of Aqaba (Nuweiba) earthquake reached Mw ~7.2 and produced strong regional shaking. Future M6–7 events are plausible in this tectonic setting. [Sources: USGS summary of the 1995 Aqaba event; regional seismotectonic studies]
- Tsunami: Low-probability but credible near-field tsunami potential in the Gulf of Aqaba/Red Sea from seismic sources or submarine slope failures; small amplitudes were documented after the 1995 event. Coastal siting warrants elevation and setback. [Sources: IOC-UNESCO/USGS regional tsunami assessments]
- Flood/flash flood: Coastal wadis descending from the escarpment can generate short-notice flash floods after intense rain. [Sources: GFDRR ThinkHazard regional screening; Saudi civil defense bulletins]
- Sea-level rise/coastal hazards: Long-term sea-level rise and storm setup/surge in the Red Sea (generally modest versus open oceans) still require freeboard and coastal protection for critical facilities. [Sources: IPCC AR6 regional sea-level projections]
- Heat and dust: Hot arid climate with marine moderation compared with inland cities; dust storms occur seasonally. [Sources: Saudi NCM; WMO]
- **Score:** 5/10
- **Explanation:** Seismic risk is the dominant concern, with credible strong shaking scenarios that drive stringent structural and nonstructural resilience needs. Additive coastal hazards (low-probability tsunami, SLR, flash floods in coastal wadis) further complicate site design and emergency access. While all are engineerable, the aggregate natural-disaster exposure is materially higher than inland alternatives, lowering the score.

## Madinah , Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Madinah (King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, 42312) lies on the Hejaz margin near extensive Holocene basaltic volcanic fields (Harrat). Key natural-hazard facts:
- Volcanic: The Harrat Rahat volcanic field directly south of Madinah last erupted in 1256 CE, with lava flows advancing to within roughly 4 km of the city. The field remains potentially active and is monitored; probability is low on an annual basis but non-zero on planning horizons. [Sources: Saudi Geological Survey volcano monitoring; peer-reviewed summaries of the 1256 eruption]
- Earthquake: Moderate regional seismicity from the Red Sea rift/transform system and harrat-related crustal processes; notable unrest includes the 2009 Harrat Lunayyir swarm (M 5.4 main event) NW of Madinah. [Sources: USGS; SGS]
- Flood/flash flood: Orography and lava-flow topography can channel intense rainfall into rapid runoff and wadi flooding within the city. Events with damaging urban flooding have been recorded in the last two decades. [Sources: GFDRR ThinkHazard screening; municipal incident reports]
- Heat and dust: Hot arid climate with frequent summer heatwaves and seasonal dust. [Sources: Saudi NCM]
- **Score:** 6/10
- **Explanation:** Compared with Riyadh, Madinah adds two natural perils of greater consequence: moderate seismicity and proximity to an historically active volcanic field. While the likelihood of a new eruption is low, its potential impact is severe and must be planned for. Flash-flood and heat/dust risks are manageable but real. Overall risk is moderate, warranting robust site selection, structural design, and multi-hazard emergency planning.

## Overall Analysis
For natural-disaster risk alone, Riyadh (8/10) is the most favorable, driven by very low seismicity and absence of coastal/volcanic hazards; remaining risks (flash floods, heat, dust) are largely mitigable. Madinah (6/10) has additional moderate seismic and low-probability volcanic hazards that increase consequence severity despite low annual likelihood. NEOM/Sharma (5/10) faces the highest combination of earthquake and coastal hazards (including low-probability tsunami and SLR) plus flash-flood potential, requiring the most stringent multi-hazard design and site-risk mitigation.

**Emergency response time (minutes)**

## Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 13331
- **Data:** Riyadh (Al Aarid district, King Abdulaziz Rd, 13331) is within the built-up urban north of Riyadh, adjacent to major arterials (King Abdulaziz Rd, proximity to Northern Ring Rd and King Salman Rd). The Saudi Red Crescent Authority (SRCA) operates multiple ambulance centers across Riyadh, and the city hosts numerous tertiary hospitals (e.g., King Abdullah Specialist Children’s Hospital, King Fahd Medical City, King Saud Medical City). In dense Riyadh districts, practical ambulance response times commonly range about 8–15 minutes depending on time-of-day congestion; peak-hour congestion is significant on main corridors. The location is near multiple graded intersections and wide arterials that facilitate ambulance priority travel. Urban signalization and heavy traffic can add several minutes during peaks, but availability of nearby EMS units and hospitals generally keeps door-to-ER times relatively short compared with non-urban areas.
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Explanation:** Urban EMS coverage with multiple nearby SRCA stations and hospitals supports faster ambulance arrival and transport, typically within roughly 8–15 minutes in practice for central/northern Riyadh. Peak congestion on major corridors is a limiting factor, preventing a 9–10 score.

## NEOM, Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** NEOM (Sharma area, 269J+WJ, 49626) is a developing coastal area in Tabuk Province with dispersed population and ongoing construction. Existing permanent hospitals and SRCA ambulance density are markedly lower than in major cities. Long inter-facility distances and limited secondary/tertiary roads mean ambulance response and transport times are often extended. While NEOM has been ramping up healthcare and onsite medical/industrial clinics for projects, the spatial spread and lower baseline EMS station density typically result in longer response intervals than urban cores. Off-peak traffic is light, but distances to comprehensive emergency care are significant.
- **Score:** 3/10
- **Explanation:** Sparse EMS/hospital network and long distances in a developing area lead to longer response and transport times. Although roads are uncongested, the low density of stations and hospitals materially increases minutes-to-arrival and time-to-definitive care.

## Madinah , Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Madinah (King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, 42312) is within the urban fabric of Madinah near major arterials (King Abdullah Rd), with established hospitals (e.g., King Fahd Hospital, Ohud Hospital, King Salman Medical City) and SRCA ambulance coverage. Madinah experiences seasonal surges in demand during Hajj/Ramadan, but road networks and EMS surge-capacity planning typically maintain urban response ranges similar to other Saudi cities. Typical urban ambulance arrival is often around 8–15 minutes depending on traffic and time of day; congestion is moderate compared with Riyadh, and key hospitals are within short drive distance from this corridor.
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Urban EMS and hospital proximity support acceptable response times, likely comparable to other mid-to-large Saudi cities. Seasonal pilgrimage peaks and occasional congestion lower reliability compared with Riyadh’s year-round resources, but overall urban access remains good.

## Overall Analysis
For emergency response time, urban settings with dense EMS and hospital networks outperform remote or developing areas. Location 1 (Riyadh) ranks highest due to extensive SRCA coverage and multiple nearby hospitals despite congestion. Location 3 (Madinah) is strong but subject to seasonal demand surges. Location 2 (NEOM/Sharma) currently has sparse EMS and hospital density, leading to longer response and transport times; this may improve as NEOM expands healthcare infrastructure.

# Research Results for Criterion:

**Land cost per acre ($)**

## Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 13331
- **Data:** Riyadh – Al Aarid District, King Abdulaziz Rd (13331). Market asking prices for commercially-suitable land along/near King Abdulaziz Road in Al Aarid are among the highest in Riyadh. Observed 2024–2025 listing ranges: about SAR 3,500–5,500 per sqm for prime commercial frontage, with interior secondary plots typically SAR 2,500–3,500 per sqm. Converted to cost per acre (1 acre = 4,046.856 sqm): SAR ~14.16–22.26 million per acre for prime frontage. At the SAR–USD peg (3.75 SAR per USD), that is approximately USD $3.78–$5.94 million per acre (midpoint ~USD $4.86 million). Notes: price varies by frontage width, access, zoning classification (commercial vs. mixed-use), and plot size; transaction prices can differ from asks.
- **Score:** 3/10
- **Explanation:** For the land cost criterion alone, Al Aarid on King Abdulaziz Rd has very high unit land prices in Riyadh, making land acquisition capital-intensive. Relative to the other two locations, its per‑acre cost is the highest, hence a lower score.

## NEOM, Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** NEOM area – Sharma (269J+WJ). Private freehold acquisition within NEOM’s core is constrained; land for institutional uses is commonly allocated/leased via government/NEOM rather than open-market purchase. In the surrounding Sharma/Tabuk coastal hinterland (outside restricted NEOM zones), observed raw-land asks (2024–2025) for large tracts generally range ~SAR 100–400 per sqm depending on proximity to the coast, access, and services. Converted to cost per acre: SAR ~0.405–1.619 million per acre, which is approximately USD $0.108–$0.432 million per acre at the SAR peg (midpoint ~USD $0.216 million). Notes: where acquisition is via government allocation in NEOM, the effective land cost to the hospital sponsor may be negotiated (potentially far below open‑market equivalents), but market comparables in the adjacent area remain much lower than major metros.
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Explanation:** Purely on land cost per acre, the NEOM/Sharma hinterland has substantially lower market land values than Riyadh and Madinah. Even accounting for NEOM’s allocation model (which can reduce or restructure land cost), the effective or comparable per‑acre cost is lowest among the three, warranting a high score.

## Madinah , Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Madinah – Al Rayah, King Abdullah Rd (42312). Urban arterial corridor with established services. Observed 2024–2025 asking ranges for commercially-suitable plots along/near King Abdullah Rd and comparable arterials in Madinah: roughly SAR 1,500–3,000 per sqm, depending on frontage, access, and permitted use. Converted to cost per acre: SAR ~6.07–12.14 million per acre, or approximately USD $1.62–$3.24 million per acre at the SAR peg (midpoint ~USD $2.37 million). Notes: prices vary by plot geometry, corner status, and proximity to major intersections and healthcare clusters; transactions can clear below ask.
- **Score:** 6/10
- **Explanation:** For land cost only, Madinah’s King Abdullah Rd corridor is materially cheaper per acre than Riyadh’s Al Aarid/King Abdulaziz Rd, but higher than NEOM/Sharma raw land. It therefore ranks in the middle on the cost criterion.

## Overall Analysis
On the single criterion of land cost per acre (USD), NEOM/Sharma offers the lowest comparable costs (or negotiated allocations), followed by Madinah’s King Abdullah Rd corridor, with Riyadh Al Aarid on King Abdulaziz Rd being the most expensive. Scores reflect a simple inverse relationship to estimated per‑acre costs. Caveats: Saudi land markets are highly location- and zoning-specific; NEOM often uses allocation/lease mechanisms rather than freehold sales; and advertised asking prices may differ from closed transaction values. Verify current quotes with local brokers and authorities before acquisition.

**Construction cost per sq ft ($)**

## Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 13331
- **Data:** Address: RRDA4539 King Abdulaziz Road, Al Aarid, Riyadh 13331, Saudi Arabia. Scope/assumptions: Acute general hospital, mid-to-high healthcare specification (JCI-compliant), building-only cost (structure, architectural, MEP, vertical transportation, normal on-plot siteworks); excludes land, design/professional fees, finance, owner FF&E/IT/medical equipment, and VAT (15%). Price basis: Q3 2025 dollars. Indicative construction cost (Riyadh market): 2,400–3,100 USD/m² (≈223–288 USD/ft²). Rationale and local factors: Riyadh is KSA’s largest construction market with strong competition among Tier-1 contractors, mature healthcare supply chain, and ready access to domestic cement/steel; however, giga-project activity (Diriyah Gate, Qiddiya, ROSHN, metro expansions) and strong private development keep tender prices elevated versus secondary cities. Inland logistics add overland haul from ports (e.g., ~400–450 km from Dammam/Jubail; ~950 km from Jeddah), partially offset by plentiful local batching plants and fabrication. Codes/standards: Saudi Building Code (SBC, IBC-based) and Ministry of Health/Health Facility Guidelines typically adopted; Riyadh’s relatively low seismicity compared to western KSA keeps structural premiums modest. Market context: Multiple international cost benchmarks (e.g., Arcadis ICC 2024/2025, Turner & Townsend ICMS 2024/2025 Middle East) show Saudi Arabia as cost-competitive globally with mid-single-digit annual escalation in 2023–2025; hospitals carry higher MEP density and infection-control fit-out costs than commercial buildings. The above range reflects current Riyadh tendering conditions and healthcare complexity.
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Riyadh benefits from a deep contractor/subcontractor market and robust supply chains, which contain risk and keep costs competitive; however, persistent market heat and inland logistics push hospital construction costs above the lowest-cost Saudi locations. On the cost-only criterion, it is mid-to-good (not best) among the three.

## NEOM, Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Address: 269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM, Saudi Arabia (Tabuk Region, Red Sea coast). Scope/assumptions: Acute general hospital, mid-to-high healthcare specification (building-only as defined for Location 1), VAT excluded; Q3 2025 dollars. Indicative construction cost (NEOM/Sharma area): 2,900–4,000 USD/m² (≈269–372 USD/ft²). Rationale and local factors: NEOM is an active giga-project zone with stringent site security, remote-worker accommodation requirements, and constrained on-site infrastructure/utilities during build-out—driving higher preliminaries, logistics, and productivity losses. While proximity to the Red Sea and the upgraded Port of NEOM (formerly Duba Port) improves seaborne material access, the local subcontractor base is thinner than in Riyadh/Jeddah/Madinah and competition for skilled labor/equipment is intense, raising margins and risk allowances. Western KSA’s higher seismic design categories versus Riyadh can add structural cost for essential facilities. Industry reporting in 2023–2025 notes capacity constraints and cost pressure across Saudi giga-projects; remote-site premiums of roughly +15–35% above tier‑1 city baselines are typical for complex healthcare assets and are reflected in the range.
- **Score:** 4/10
- **Explanation:** Remote-site conditions, giga-project competition for labor/plant, and higher preliminaries lead to the highest $/ft² of the three locations despite port proximity. On a cost-per-square-foot basis alone, NEOM is the least favorable.

## Madinah , Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Address: King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312, Saudi Arabia. Scope/assumptions: Acute general hospital, mid-to-high healthcare specification (building-only as defined), VAT excluded; Q3 2025 dollars. Indicative construction cost (Madinah market): 2,300–3,000 USD/m² (≈214–279 USD/ft²). Rationale and local factors: Madinah is a major western KSA city with established contractors and access to western ports (e.g., Yanbu ~170–200 km; Jeddah ~330–360 km), which supports competitive material logistics. Compared with Riyadh, the market is somewhat less overheated by giga‑project workloads, and logistics distances to ports are shorter, often yielding slightly lower tender pricing for comparable healthcare scope. Western KSA seismic design requirements can be higher than Riyadh but are generally offset by logistics advantages and market workload. National context remains as per contemporary benchmarks (Arcadis ICC 2024/2025; Turner & Townsend 2024/2025 Middle East), with hospitals carrying MEP‑intensive premiums over commercial builds; the stated range reflects recent western‑region tendering conditions for complex healthcare.
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Explanation:** Among the three, Madinah typically offers the lowest hospital construction $/ft² due to balanced competition, strong western‑region logistics via Yanbu/Jeddah, and fewer giga‑project capacity constraints than NEOM or Riyadh. Thus it scores best on the cost-only criterion.

## Overall Analysis
All three locations are globally competitive for healthcare build costs, but local market conditions and logistics materially affect $/ft². Indicative 2025 ranges: Madinah ≈214–279 USD/ft² (lowest), Riyadh ≈223–288 USD/ft² (mid), NEOM ≈269–372 USD/ft² (highest). These are building-only planning ranges for acute hospital projects and exclude land, fees, finance, VAT, and owner-supplied equipment. Rankings here consider only construction cost per square foot: Madinah (8/10), Riyadh (7/10), NEOM (4/10). If you proceed, commission a location-specific cost plan with geotech, utility availability, program detail, and market testing; final pricing can vary outside the ranges based on specification, procurement strategy, and timing.

**Median age of population**

## Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 13331
- **Data:** Address: RRDA4539 King Abdulaziz Rd, Al Aarid, Riyadh 13331, Saudi Arabia (Riyadh city, Riyadh Region). Best-available age statistics: Saudi Arabia’s median age is in the low 30s in the early 2020s per United Nations World Population Prospects; the country has a youthful structure among nationals and a large working-age expatriate segment. Riyadh Region (which includes Riyadh city) has one of the highest concentrations of working‑age expatriates in the Kingdom, which shifts the age profile toward adults (25–44) and generally yields a higher median age than many non-metropolitan regions. Riyadh city itself is highly urbanized with fewer children per household than rural areas, further nudging the median age upward relative to the national average of a decade ago. Sources: UN World Population Prospects (https://population.un.org/wpp/); Saudi 2022 Census – General Authority for Statistics regional profiles (https://www.stats.gov.sa/).
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Explanation:** Scored higher because, relative to other Saudi regions, Riyadh’s population skews more to working‑age adults and somewhat older median age than peripheral regions, implying greater immediate demand for hospital services (chronic disease management, surgical volumes) than a younger region. While still young compared with many OECD cities, Riyadh is older than Tabuk/NEOM and likely modestly older than Madinah.

## NEOM, Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Address: 269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM, Saudi Arabia (Tabuk Region, northwest coast). Best-available age statistics: National median age is in the low 30s (UN WPP). The NEOM/Sharma area’s current resident base is small and dominated by project/workforce populations in working ages (largely 20s–40s), with comparatively few elderly residents. Tabuk Region overall is less urbanized than Riyadh and historically has a younger age structure (higher fertility among Saudi nationals and a smaller proportion of long‑term elderly residents). Sources: UN World Population Prospects (https://population.un.org/wpp/); Saudi 2022 Census regional reporting for Tabuk (https://www.stats.gov.sa/).
- **Score:** 5/10
- **Explanation:** Scored lower on median‑age criterion because the present age mix in the NEOM/Sharma catchment is heavily working‑age with very limited older population, implying lower near‑term age‑driven hospital demand (e.g., for geriatric, CV, oncology admissions) compared with Riyadh and Madinah. As NEOM matures and attracts families/retirees, the score could rise.

## Madinah , Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Address: King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312, Saudi Arabia (Madinah city, Madinah Region). Best-available age statistics: Saudi Arabia’s national median age is in the low 30s (UN WPP). Madinah Region’s resident population includes both young Saudi nationals and a substantial working‑age expatriate segment but is generally younger than Riyadh’s overall age profile. Pilgrimage influx raises the number of elderly visitors seasonally, but visitors do not change the resident median age. Sources: UN World Population Prospects (https://population.un.org/wpp/); Saudi 2022 Census regional profiles (https://www.stats.gov.sa/).
- **Score:** 6/10
- **Explanation:** Scored in the middle: Madinah’s resident median age is likely younger than Riyadh’s but older than remote Tabuk/NEOM areas because of its urban character and expatriate workforce. Seasonal elderly visitors increase episodic care needs but do not affect resident median age; thus, on a pure median‑age basis it ranks between Riyadh and NEOM.

## Overall Analysis
Exact median age at neighborhood/city level is not officially published; the best-available measures are national and regional age structures. Using those, Riyadh is likely to have the oldest median age among the three due to its large, urban, working‑age and somewhat older adult mix, followed by Madinah, with NEOM/Sharma the youngest (project‑workforce dominated). For hospital placement on a median‑age criterion alone (older = stronger near‑term demand), Riyadh ranks best, Madinah moderate, NEOM lower pending future demographic maturation.

Notes: Distances are straight-line estimates from the Al Rayah location; specialty centers and PHCs excluded.
- **Score:** 2/10
- **Explanation:** At least six sizable acute-care hospitals within ~10 km indicate high competition; thus, this site scores low (2/10) on the competition criterion.

## Overall Analysis
On the single criterion of number of competing hospitals within 10 km, the NEOM/Sharma site is most favorable (no competitors), Riyadh Al Aarid has moderate competition (about four hospitals), and the Madinah Al Rayah site has heavy competition (about six hospitals). If other siting factors are equal, Location 2 ranks best, followed by Location 1, then Location 3.

# Research Results for Criterion:

**Population density (people per sq km)**

## Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 13331
- **Data:** Riyadh (Al Aarid, King Abdulaziz Rd). Latest official city-level density: ~3,891 people/km² (2022 Census population ≈ 7,676,654; administrative city area ≈ 1,973 km²). Al Aarid is a rapidly urbanizing northern district within the built-up urban area, implying medium-to-high local residential density consistent with city averages. Sources: Saudi 2022 Census (GASTAT) for population; ArRiyadh Development Authority/Widely cited municipal figures for area.
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Explanation:** High urban population density and ongoing residential development yield a large immediate catchment, making the site very favorable for hospital placement when density is the criterion.

## NEOM, Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** NEOM/Sharma (269J+WJ, Tabuk Province). Current surrounding density is very low. Provincial reference: Tabuk Region density ≈ 7 people/km² (2022 population ≈ 1.0 million; area ≈ 146,000 km²). The immediate Sharma/NEOM coastal area remains sparsely populated with small settlements and construction camps; present local density is likely below the provincial average. Sources: Saudi 2022 Census (GASTAT) for regional population; widely cited provincial area figures; NEOM is a developing zone with limited current residency.
- **Score:** 1/10
- **Explanation:** Extremely low current population density means a small resident catchment for a hospital at present, despite long-term development plans.

## Madinah , Saudi Arabia
- **Data:** Madinah (King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah). City-level density: ~2,528 people/km² (2022 Census population ≈ 1,488,782; city administrative area ≈ 589 km²). The site is within the built-up urban fabric along a major corridor, indicating moderate-to-high local density relative to city averages. Sources: Saudi 2022 Census (GASTAT) for population; commonly cited municipal area for Medina.
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Explanation:** Substantial urban population density provides a strong resident catchment. While lower than Riyadh’s overall density, it is still favorable for hospital placement on a density basis.

## Overall Analysis
On current population density alone: Riyadh (Al Aarid) ranks best (≈3,891/km²), Madinah is strong but lower (≈2,528/km²), and NEOM/Sharma is currently very sparse (≈7/km² regionally; local likely lower). Thus, Location 1 > Location 3 >> Location 2 for immediate hospital demand based on resident density.
