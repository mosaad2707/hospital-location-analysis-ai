**Chronic disease prevalence rate (%)**

## RIYADH SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (King Abdulaziz Rd, Al Aarid 13331) sits in the Riyadh Region and is the country’s largest metropolitan area (city ~7.7–8.0 million; region >8.5 million; GASTAT). Chronic noncommunicable disease (NCD) prevalence is high in central KSA. Diabetes: National adult (20–79y) prevalence ≈18–19% (IDF Diabetes Atlas 10th ed., 2021). Riyadh-focused studies commonly report ~20–23% among adults (e.g., Saudi Health Interview Survey [SHIS] 2013/analysis and local cross-sectional studies). Hypertension: pooled estimates for KSA ≈26–29% among adults; Riyadh-region findings are in the same range (WHO/MOH NCD surveys; meta-analyses). Obesity: adult BMI ≥30 is common in KSA (~35% overall; WHO NCD profiles); Riyadh-area studies often report ~35–40% in adults. These rates, multiplied by Riyadh’s large population, imply very high absolute numbers of patients with chronic diseases requiring ongoing care, complications management, and specialized services (cardio-metabolic clinics, dialysis, etc.). Key sources: Saudi MOH/WHO STEPS/SHIS surveys; IDF Diabetes Atlas (KSA ≈18.3% adults with diabetes, 2021); WHO NCD Country Profile (adult obesity ~35%).
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Explanation:** Very high chronic disease prevalence combined with the largest population base in KSA produces the highest absolute burden of NCDs among the three sites, strongly supporting hospital placement on this criterion alone. The breadth of need (diabetes, hypertension, obesity and downstream complications) is substantial and sustained.

## NEOM SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** NEOM, Saudi Arabia (269J+WJ, Sharma 49626) is within Tabuk Province on the Red Sea. Current permanent residential population in the immediate NEOM/Sharma area is still limited (development-phase workforce and early residents), while Tabuk Region’s total population is ~1.0–1.1 million (GASTAT). Planned NEOM population is marketed at up to ~9 million in the long term, but this is not yet realized. Chronic disease prevalence in Tabuk Region aligns with national KSA patterns. Diabetes: ≈18–22% of adults (national 18–19% per IDF 2021; Tabuk regional studies report similar adult T2DM ranges). Hypertension: ≈22–26% adults (consistent with KSA pooled estimates). Obesity: ≈30–36% adults (near national levels; WHO/MOH data). While percentage prevalence is material, the current absolute number of chronically ill residents in the NEOM/Sharma catchment is still relatively small compared to Riyadh or Madinah. Key sources: IDF Diabetes Atlas 2021 (KSA ~18.3%); Saudi MOH/WHO NCD risk factor surveys (STEPwise/SHIS); Tabuk-region cross-sectional studies showing diabetes and hypertension rates close to national means.
- **Score:** 3/10
- **Explanation:** Prevalence percentages are meaningful but the present local population base is comparatively small, yielding a lower immediate absolute burden of chronic disease. Until the planned NEOM population materializes, this site scores lower for hospital placement on the chronic-disease-prevalence criterion alone.

## MEDINA SAUDI ARBIA
- **Data:** Madinah (King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah 42312) is the capital of Al Madinah Region. City population ~1.3–1.5 million; regional population ~2+ million (GASTAT). Peer-reviewed studies from Al Madinah report high adult diabetes prevalence, often ~24–28% in community samples (some reports ~23.8% and higher in older age groups), above or at the upper end of national averages. Hypertension: ~23–27% adults in regional/community studies, in line with KSA pooled estimates. Obesity: ~33–40% adults, comparable to national levels reported by WHO/MOH. Given the sizable resident base and elevated diabetes prevalence documented locally, the absolute burden of chronic disease is substantial and persistent, with significant demand for long-term NCD services (endocrinology, cardiology, renal care). Key sources: Local Al Madinah cross-sectional studies on diabetes and NCD risk factors; IDF Diabetes Atlas 2021 (national diabetes ≈18.3%); WHO/MOH NCD surveillance showing high adult obesity and hypertension in KSA.
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Explanation:** High chronic disease prevalence, particularly diabetes, combined with a sizable urban population produces a large absolute NCD burden. While smaller than Riyadh in total population, Madinah’s documented rates warrant strong consideration for hospital placement on this criterion.

## Overall Analysis
On the chronic-disease-prevalence (%) criterion, all three sites reflect Saudi Arabia’s high NCD burden. Riyadh scores highest because high prevalence is paired with the country’s largest population, maximizing absolute caseload. Madinah also shows high prevalence (notably diabetes) and a substantial population, supporting a strong score. NEOM/Sharma has prevalence similar to national/regional norms but a much smaller current resident base; thus, despite meaningful percentages, the immediate absolute burden is low, yielding the lowest score for this criterion. Sources underpinning these assessments include the IDF Diabetes Atlas (KSA adults with diabetes ≈18.3% in 2021), WHO/Ministry of Health NCD surveillance (STEPwise/SHIS) indicating high adult obesity (~35%) and significant hypertension prevalence (~25%+), and region-specific studies for Madinah and Tabuk showing values close to or above national means.

# Research Results for Criterion:

**Annual population growth rate (%)**

## RIYADH SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Address: RRDA4539 King Abdulaziz Road, Al Aarid, Riyadh 13331. Riyadh city population (GASTAT census): ~5.24 million (2010) to ~7.68 million (2022). Implied annual population growth (CAGR 2010–2022): ≈3.2% per year. Riyadh continues to attract the largest net internal migration in Saudi Arabia and is the focal point of Vision 2030 urban expansion, with policy targets to substantially increase residents over the next decade (supporting sustained above-national-average growth).
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Explanation:** A large, fast-growing metropolitan base with a ~3% annual growth rate over the last census-to-census period and strong policy tailwinds makes Riyadh highly favorable for hospital demand growth and service scalability. High certainty of continued in-migration supports a near-term planning baseline around 3%.

## NEOM SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Address: 269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM, Saudi Arabia (Tabuk Region, Red Sea coast). Current resident base in the immediate NEOM/Sharma area is still small, but the wider Tabuk Region grew from ~0.79 million (2010) to ~0.91 million (2022), implying ≈1.1–1.3% annual growth (CAGR). NEOM project announcements envision several hundred thousand residents in the 2030 time frame and multi-million long-term capacity, which would imply very high localized growth if realized; however, timelines have been revised and near-term realization remains uncertain.
- **Score:** 6/10
- **Explanation:** Observed regional growth is modest (~1–1.3%/yr), while project-driven growth could be extremely high from a small base but carries execution and timing risk. From a hospital planning standpoint, near-term population growth is less certain than in established cities, tempering the score despite long-term potential.

## MEDINA SAUDI ARBIA
- **Data:** Address: King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312. Medina (Al Madinah Al Munawwarah) city population (GASTAT census): ~1.10 million (2010) to ~1.5 million (2022). Implied annual population growth (CAGR 2010–2022): ≈2.6–2.9% per year (≈2.7% baseline). The city’s resident population grows steadily and demand is further influenced by substantial seasonal pilgrim inflows (not counted in resident growth but relevant to service demand).
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Medina shows solid resident growth (~2.7%/yr) and sustained urban expansion, supporting hospital demand growth. While its absolute base is smaller than Riyadh, growth is steady and more certain than project-driven areas, warranting a strong score.

## Overall Analysis
By the annual population growth criterion, Riyadh ranks best (≈3.2%/yr and high certainty), Medina is second (≈2.7%/yr, steady), and NEOM/Sharma is third (regional ≈1–1.3%/yr observed with high but uncertain project-led upside). For hospital placement focused on near- to medium-term demand growth, prioritize Riyadh, then Medina; NEOM’s potential is substantial but timing and realization are uncertain.

- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Riyadh offers the strongest public transport in Saudi Arabia today via the operational Riyadh Bus and phased metro. Along King Abdulaziz Rd in Al Aarid, bus access is reasonable but not as dense/frequent as central districts, and the nearest metro stations are not immediately adjacent yet. Good arterial access and e-hailing help, but current mass transit proximity is moderate, not excellent.

## NEOM SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** {'address': '269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM, Saudi Arabia (northwestern Tabuk Region, Red Sea coast)', 'urban_context': 'Emerging NEOM/Sharma area with sparse, developing settlement pattern; large-scale projects (e.g., The Line, Oxagon, Sindalah) at varying stages of build-out.', 'public_transport_options': {'bus': {'network': 'No established urban bus network in Sharma/NEOM area for public use as of 2025.', 'current_practice': 'Construction/employee shuttles and private site transport exist but not general public mass transit.'}, 'rail_metro': {'status': 'No operational metro/commuter rail in NEOM/Sharma as of 2025.

- **Score:** 2/10
- **Explanation:** Public transport is largely absent in the Sharma/NEOM location today. While future NEOM transit is planned, current accessibility for the general public via buses/rail is minimal. Access relies on roads, private vehicles, and internal shuttles, which is poor for a hospital’s public transport accessibility criterion.

## MEDINA SAUDI ARBIA
- **Data:** {'address': 'King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312, Saudi Arabia', 'urban_context': 'Urban corridor east of central Al Madinah Al Munawwarah; King Abdullah Rd is a major arterial with connections to the central area and ring roads.', 'public_transport_options': {'bus': {'network': 'Madinah Public Transport (city bus network) operated under government contracts; expanded services around central and arterial corridors.', 'relevant_corridors': ['King Abdullah Rd is a principal corridor with bus coverage linking residential districts to central Madinah and the Prophet’s Mosque area.'], 'stop_density': 'Moderate along the arterial; typical stop spacing 300–600 m in urban sections.', 'service_frequency': 'Less frequent than Riyadh; typical headways 15–30+ minutes depending on route/time; improved frequencies on core lines and during pilgrimage peaks.'}, 'rail': {'Haramain_High_Speed': 'Connects Madinah to Jeddah, KAEC, and Makkah from Madinah station on King Abdulaziz Rd (intercity; not local transit).', 'proximity': 'Haramain station is several kilometers from Al Rayah; useful for regional access but not local last-mile.'}, 'taxis_ehail': 'Common (taxis, Uber/Careem), especially given pilgrimage travel demand.', 'parking_road_access': 'Strong arterial access; high seasonal traffic during Hajj/Umrah periods.'}, 'constraints_opportunities': ['Seasonal surges can strain bus reliability and road congestion.', 'Reasonable bus coverage along King Abdullah Rd, but overall city network is thinner and less frequent than Riyadh.']}
- **Score:** 6/10
- **Explanation:** Madinah provides functional city bus service along major arterials like King Abdullah Rd and robust taxi/e-hailing availability, with added intercity rail at the Haramain station. However, local mass transit is less dense/frequent than Riyadh and is impacted by seasonal demand, yielding moderate public transport accessibility.

## Overall Analysis
For public transportation accessibility today, Riyadh (Location 1) ranks best due to the operational citywide bus network and progressing metro, though the specific Al Aarid site is not next to a metro station yet. Madinah (Location 3) has moderate bus coverage on King Abdullah Rd and strong taxi/e-hail availability but lower frequencies and seasonal variability. NEOM/Sharma (Location 2) currently lacks public transit for the general public, relying on roads and private/company transport; future plans do not change present accessibility. Scores reflect current (2025) accessibility, not planned future systems.

# Research Results for Criterion:

**Zoning compliance score**

## RIYADH SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Address: King Abdulaziz Rd, Al Aarid, Riyadh 13331, Saudi Arabia. Jurisdiction/permits: Riyadh Region Municipality and Royal Commission for Riyadh City (RCRC) oversee land use and corridor controls in Riyadh; building/use permitting falls under the Ministry of Municipal, Rural Affairs and Housing (MoMRAH). King Abdulaziz Rd is a principal/arterial corridor in North Riyadh with mixed-use and services activities permitted along major frontages per RCRC corridor planning policies (RCRC – Riyadh Development Plan/Corridor policies; MoMRAH Unified Municipal Regulations). Saudi municipal practice allows hospitals/medical complexes on major roads subject to minimum road width (commonly ≥30–40 m) and parking/setback standards per MoMRAH’s technical requirements for health facilities. Al Aarid is a developing district with extensive commercial strips along King Abdulaziz Rd; multiple licensed hospitals and medical complexes already operate on similar Riyadh arterials, indicating use compatibility along such corridors. Authorities: RCRC (corridor/urban design approvals), Riyadh Municipality (land-use compliance/building permit), MoH for health facility licensing, and Civil Defense (safety).
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Explanation:** Strong likelihood of zoning compatibility for a hospital along a primary Riyadh arterial where service/commercial uses are generally permitted, subject to meeting corridor controls, plot compliance, setbacks, parking, access management, and MoH technical standards. Final score reflects remaining risks (exact parcel zoning classification and RCRC corridor requirements must be verified on the official cadastral/zoning layer before permitting).

## NEOM SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Address: 269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM, Saudi Arabia. Jurisdiction/permits: The NEOM territory is administered by the NEOM Authority with its own planning and permitting regime; development approvals are handled through NEOM Company/Authority rather than the standard municipal pathway. NEOM has announced dedicated healthcare developments and bespoke codes, and NEOM/Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital have publicized plans for hospital services in NEOM, showing policy support for healthcare uses within planned districts. However, Sharma’s coastal area includes environmentally sensitive coastal/marine zones and designated development districts; site-specific zoning is controlled by NEOM masterplans and environmental regulations. Development typically requires NEOM Authority approvals, environmental assessment, and compliance with NEOM codes rather than conventional municipal zoning.
- **Score:** 6/10
- **Explanation:** Healthcare is strategically supported in NEOM, but zoning compliance is highly site-specific to NEOM’s masterplans. A random site near Sharma may fall within protected or non-developable coastal zones or reserved program areas. The pathway is feasible if the parcel is within a designated development zone and approved in the NEOM planning framework; otherwise not. Score reflects policy alignment but elevated uncertainty pending NEOM parcel zoning confirmation.

## MEDINA SAUDI ARBIA
- **Data:** Address: King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312, Saudi Arabia. Jurisdiction/permits: Al Madinah Region Municipality and Al Madinah Region Development Authority oversee land use; MoMRAH provides national municipal/building regulations; Ministry of Health licenses hospitals. King Abdullah Rd is a major urban corridor in Madinah with established mixed-use/service frontage. Hospitals and medical complexes are commonly sited along major arterials in Saudi cities under municipal use matrices, subject to road width (typically ≥30–40 m), parking, setbacks, and access control. The corridor already hosts various commercial/service uses and provides strong regional access, which is consistent with hospital siting norms. Approvals required: municipality land-use compliance, building permit, Civil Defense safety approval, MoH facility licensing.
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Explanation:** High compatibility for hospital use on a principal Madinah corridor with established mixed/service frontage. As with Riyadh, exact parcel zoning and corridor design controls must be verified on the municipal zoning/cadastral map. Score reflects strong likelihood of conformity with standard Saudi municipal use matrices for hospitals along major roads, with routine permitting conditions.

## Overall Analysis
Across Saudi cities, hospitals are typically permitted along major arterial corridors under MoMRAH/municipal use matrices, subject to road width, access, parking, setbacks, and safety requirements. Location 1 (Riyadh/King Abdulaziz Rd) and Location 3 (Madinah/King Abdullah Rd) align well with these norms and score high, pending parcel-level zoning confirmation. Location 2 (NEOM/Sharma) depends on NEOM Authority masterplans and may face environmental/zone restrictions despite strategic support for healthcare; thus a moderate score due to higher zoning uncertainty. For all sites, official cadastral/zoning verification and authority pre-application meetings are recommended before acquisition/design.

# Research Results for Criterion:

**Average household income ($)**

## RIYADH SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** No official city- or neighborhood-level average household income is published for Riyadh at the address level. The best available national benchmark from the General Authority for Statistics (GASTAT) Household Income and Expenditure Survey (2018) shows: average monthly income for Saudi citizen households = SAR 14,823 (~$3,953 at 3.75 SAR/USD), or ~$47,436/year; average monthly income for all households (Saudi + non-Saudi) = SAR 11,984 (~$3,196), or ~$38,352/year. Riyadh is the economic center of Saudi Arabia with a concentration of higher-wage government, finance, and corporate headquarters; labor-market data consistently show Riyadh among the highest-wage regions, so average household income in Riyadh is generally above the national average.
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Explanation:** For hospital placement focused on income, Riyadh offers one of the highest household earning capacities in the country, translating to stronger private-payer and supplemental insurance demand. Even without an official city-level household income figure, Riyadh’s role as the national economic hub and consistently higher regional wages support a top-tier income profile.

## NEOM SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** The NEOM address (Sharma, Tabuk Region) is within a special economic zone under development. There is no official average household income published for NEOM/Sharma specifically. National benchmark (GASTAT 2018): Saudi households average SAR 14,823/month (~$3,953), all households average SAR 11,984/month (~$3,196). Regional historical data indicate Tabuk Region’s average wages are below Riyadh’s, but NEOM’s on-site workforce (engineers, project managers, skilled contractors) typically earns above regional averages under corporate packages. However, the permanent resident household base in Sharma/NEOM remains limited and atypical compared with established cities.
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Income among NEOM’s current workforce is likely high, which is favorable for private hospital revenue per capita. Yet the limited and evolving permanent household base and the two-track mix (high-paid project staff vs. surrounding communities) temper the advantage when considering household income as the sole criterion.

## MEDINA SAUDI ARBIA
- **Data:** No official Medina city average household income is published. Using national benchmark (GASTAT 2018): Saudi households average SAR 14,823/month (~$3,953), all households average SAR 11,984/month (~$3,196). Medina (Madinah) Region’s income levels are generally closer to national averages and below Riyadh’s. The city attracts significant religious tourism, but local household earnings are typically moderate relative to Riyadh.
- **Score:** 6/10
- **Explanation:** Compared with Riyadh, Medina’s household income profile is more moderate, implying a smaller high-income private-payer base. It remains viable but scores lower than Riyadh on income alone.

## Overall Analysis
Using the best available official benchmark (GASTAT 2018) and regional economic context, Riyadh ranks highest on household income potential, NEOM has a high-income workforce but a nascent and atypical household base, and Medina is closer to national averages. Scores reflect expected household earning power at each site, not broader feasibility factors. Note: Saudi Arabia does not publish granular, address-level household income; figures cited are national benchmarks with regional context, converted at the SAR-USD peg (~3.75).

# Research Results for Criterion:

**Physician availability per 1000 people**

## RIYADH SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Address falls within Riyadh city, Riyadh Region. Latest region-level physician density data (all sectors) indicate Riyadh Region has roughly 33–36 physicians per 10,000 population (≈3.3–3.6 per 1,000). Sources: Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) Health Indicators/Statistical Yearbook (regional physician density tables; 2021–2022 editions) and MOH Open Data. National reference: Saudi Arabia overall ~2.7–3.0 physicians per 1,000 (WHO/World Bank). Riyadh, as the capital, concentrates tertiary hospitals and specialists, so physician availability around Al Aarid/King Abdulaziz Rd is high relative to national and most regions. Key sources: MOH Statistical Yearbook and Health Indicators portal (https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/Ministry/Statistics/Book/Pages/default.aspx, https://www.moh.gov.sa/en/Ministry/Statistics/Indicator/Pages/default.aspx), WHO Global Health Observatory/World Bank physicians per 1,000 (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.PHYS.ZS).
- **Score:** 3/10
- **Explanation:** Riyadh Region has one of the highest physician-per-1,000 ratios in the Kingdom (≈3.3–3.6/1,000). Given this criterion alone (physician availability), high existing physician density suggests lower unmet need for additional physician capacity at this location compared to less-served regions.

## NEOM SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Address is in Sharma (NEOM area), Tabuk Region. Region-level physician density is lower than Riyadh, approximately 20–24 physicians per 10,000 population (≈2.0–2.4 per 1,000). In rural coastal areas like Sharma, the on-the-ground availability is typically below the regional average; existing facilities are limited (small primary care centers; nearest general hospitals are in Duba, Al Wajh, or Tabuk city). NEOM has employer-run clinics for project staff, but public specialist availability locally is sparse. Sources: MOH Health Indicators/Statistical Yearbook regional physician density tables (2021–2022), MOH Open Data; context on Tabuk Region facilities from MOH facility listings; national benchmark from WHO/World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.PHYS.ZS).
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Explanation:** Tabuk Region’s physician density (~2.0–2.4/1,000) is below Riyadh and near the national average, and the immediate Sharma/NEOM vicinity has very limited local physician presence. On the physician-availability criterion, this area shows a clear gap, making it favorable for new hospital placement to improve access.

## MEDINA SAUDI ARBIA
- **Data:** Address is in Madinah city, Madinah Region. Region-level physician density is approximately 18–21 physicians per 10,000 population (≈1.8–2.1 per 1,000), below Riyadh and close to or slightly below the national average. While Madinah hosts several major hospitals, physician availability per resident is lower than top-supplied regions; demand spikes occur during pilgrim seasons, but the density metric reflects resident population. Sources: MOH Health Indicators/Statistical Yearbook regional physician density tables (2021–2022), MOH Open Data; national benchmark from WHO/World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.MED.PHYS.ZS).
- **Score:** 6/10
- **Explanation:** With physician density around ~1.8–2.1/1,000, Madinah Region is less supplied than Riyadh but somewhat better than many remote areas. On the physician-availability criterion alone, there is moderate room to add physician capacity, supporting a mid-to-high suitability score.

## Overall Analysis
Using physician availability per 1,000 people as the sole criterion, Riyadh (≈3.3–3.6/1,000) is relatively saturated, Madinah (≈1.8–2.1/1,000) shows moderate undersupply, and the NEOM/Sharma area in Tabuk (≈2.0–2.4/1,000 regionally, likely lower locally) shows the clearest gap. Thus, for hospital placement focused on improving physician availability, NEOM/Sharma ranks highest, followed by Madinah, then Riyadh. Notes: precise city/neighborhood-level physician densities are not publicly broken out; values cited are region-level from MOH Health Indicators/Statistical Yearbooks (latest available, ~2021–2022) with national benchmarks from WHO/World Bank.

- **Score:** 7.3/10
- **Explanation:** Strengths: very low seismic risk; inland location avoids coastal surge/tsunami; mature megacity infrastructure with improving drainage. Main environmental risks are extreme heat, frequent dust storms/poor AQ episodes, and episodic urban flash flooding along wadis. With appropriate stormwater, filtration/HVAC, and heat-resilient design, risks are manageable; hence above-average suitability but not top-tier.

- **Data:** {'address': '269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM, Saudi Arabia (Tabuk Region, Red Sea coast)', 'geographic_context': 'Coastal site near Gulf of Aqaba/Red Sea; mountainous hinterland with steep wadis draining to coast', 'climate_extremes': {'summer_highs': 'Typically 35–42°C on the coast; humidity elevates heat index', 'winter_conditions': 'Mild; occasional cool nights inland', 'rainfall': 'Very low annual average (~30–80 mm) but highly episodic; short-duration cloudbursts in wadi catchments', 'wind_dust': 'Sea breezes moderate temperatures; regional dust events occur but typically less severe than interior'}, 'air_quality': 'Generally good baseline due to remoteness and marine ventilation; dust intrusions still possible seasonally', 'hydrology_flood': {'flash_flood_risk': 'High in coastal alluvial fans/wadis after rare but intense storms; rapid runoff from steep topography can cause short-notice flooding', 'sea_level_rise': 'Long-term SLR exposure for low-lying coastal parcels; need finished-floor elevation and coastal setback', 'storm_surge': 'Red Sea cyclonic activity is rare; surge potential lower than open oceans but not zero'}, 'seismic_volcanic': {'seismicity': 'Moderate; proximity to the Dead Sea Transform/Gulf of Aqaba segment (Mw 7.3 1995 Gulf of Aqaba earthquake caused regional damage); design for higher seismic loads compared with central KSA', 'tsunami': 'Tsunami potential in the Gulf of Aqaba/Red Sea is low-to-moderate; historical accounts and modeling indicate localized tsunamis possible from seismic/landslide sources', 'volcanism': 'Harrat volcanic fields exist in western KSA but not immediately adjacent to Sharma; volcanic risk low'}, 'geotechnical_soils': {'substrate': 'Coastal sediments/alluvium and potentially coral-limestone; risk of collapsible sands, localized soft soils, and liquefaction in saturated zones; corrosion risk from saline groundwater/marine aerosol', 'foundations': 'Potential need for deep foundations/ground improvement and aggressive corrosion protection'}, 'heat_resilience_implications': 'High latent and sensible cooling loads; humidity control critical for infection prevention and occupant comfort', 'other_environmental_considerations': {'marine_ecology': 'Proximity to sensitive coral reef ecosystems; construction/operations must manage runoff and wastewater stringently', 'infrastructure_phase': 'NEOM area is under rapid development; utilities and access networks may be evolving, requiring resilience-oriented on-site systems initially'}}
- **Score:** 6.2/10
- **Explanation:** Strengths: cleaner air, marine moderation of extreme heat, large greenfield planning envelope. Risks: higher seismic hazard (Aqaba fault), coastal flood/SLR exposure, wadi flash floods, saline/corrosive coastal environment, and evolving infrastructure. With seismic/corrosion/coastal flood mitigation, risk is acceptable but higher than central KSA; thus moderate suitability.

## MEDINA SAUDI ARBIA
- **Data:** {'address': 'King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312, Saudi Arabia', 'geographic_context': 'Western Saudi Arabia, inland from Red Sea; semi-arid; traversed by historic wadis (e.g., Wadi Al-Aqiq catchment influences greater Madinah)', 'climate_extremes': {'summer_highs': 'Typically 42–46°C; hot and dry', 'rainfall': 'Low annual average (~40–80 mm) but convective storms can be intense', 'dust_sandstorms': 'Seasonal dust events; less frequent than Riyadh but significant during shamal periods'}, 'air_quality': 'Urban dust and traffic emissions; episodic dust storm spikes; generally fewer industrial sources than Riyadh core', 'hydrology_flood': {'flash_flood_history': 'Documented flash floods impacting parts of Madinah during heavy rains due to wadi overland flow and drainage exceedance', 'site_note': 'King Abdullah Rd corridor has major drainage infrastructure, but local siting should avoid wadi thalwegs and ensure offsite detention'}, 'seismic_volcanic': {'seismicity': 'Moderate relative to Riyadh; western KSA influenced by Red Sea rifting and Dead Sea Transform stresses', 'volcanism': 'Proximity to Harrat Rahat volcanic field; historical eruption in 1256 CE advanced toward Madinah; modern seismic swarms recorded south of city.

- **Score:** 6.8/10
- **Explanation:** Strengths: inland (no coastal surge), urban infrastructure, air quality generally better than Riyadh’s central core on non-dust days. Risks: moderate seismicity and proximity to Harrat Rahat (low-likelihood volcanic but material), episodic flash flooding along wadis, and high heat/dust. With careful site selection away from wadi channels and robust structural/HVAC design, suitability is moderately good.

## Overall Analysis
All three sites face arid-climate risks: extreme heat, dust, and episodic flash flooding. Environmental hazard differentials are: Riyadh—lowest seismic risk but highest dust/urban heat and notable urban flash-flood exposure; NEOM/Sharma—cleanest air and moderated temperatures but higher seismicity, coastal/SLR and wadi flash-flood exposure, and corrosive marine environment; Madinah—moderate seismic/volcanic context (Harrat Rahat) and flash-flood risk without coastal hazards. Net environmental suitability for hospital siting is highest in Riyadh (7.3) given low seismicity and mature infrastructure, followed by Madinah (6.8), then NEOM/Sharma (6.2) due to coastal and seismic factors. Site-specific hydrologic, geotechnical, and seismic studies remain essential for any final placement.

# Research Results for Criterion:

**Proximity to major highways (km)**

## RIYADH SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Address sits directly on King Abdulaziz Road in Al Aarid, a primary north–south arterial in northern Riyadh that connects to multiple expressways. Nearest major corridors (straight‑line distances, approx.): King Abdulaziz Road (0 km; at site), King Salman Road (~2 km to the north), Northern Ring Road/Route 6130 (~7 km to the south), King Fahd Road/Route 65 (~6–7 km to the west), Airport Road/Prince Mohammed bin Salman Rd (~5–6 km to the east). These corridors provide immediate access to citywide and intercity networks.
- **Score:** 10/10
- **Explanation:** Being directly on a major arterial with multiple expressway interchanges within a few kilometers offers excellent emergency access and regional connectivity. Redundant routes (north–south and east–west) and proximity to the ring road make this location optimal on the highway proximity criterion.

## NEOM SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Plus Code 269J+WJ (Sharma, NEOM) lies on the Red Sea coast adjacent to the national Coastal Highway (Route 5). Nearest major corridor (straight‑line): Saudi Highway 5 (~0.5–1.0 km, running north–south through/along Sharma). The area has limited alternative high‑capacity routes inland; most regional access is via Highway 5.
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Proximity to a single major national highway is good (sub‑1 km), but the network offers fewer alternate high‑capacity corridors compared to major cities. On the proximity metric alone this scores well, yet it is somewhat constrained by a single‑corridor dependency.

## MEDINA SAUDI ARBIA
- **Data:** The address is on King Abdullah Road in Al Rayah, Medina—an urban expressway‑class arterial connecting to the city’s ring and intercity routes. Nearest major corridors (straight‑line distances, approx.): King Abdullah Road (0 km; at site), Medina Ring Road/Prince Naif Rd (~1.5–2.0 km), Yanbu–Medina Expressway/Route 60 (~2–4 km westward connection), Highway 15 (Medina–Qassim/Makkah corridor) via ring connectors (~4–6 km).
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Explanation:** Direct frontage on a major arterial with quick access to the ring road and two intercity expressways provides strong connectivity. Slightly fewer immediate multi‑directional expressway options than the Riyadh site, but still excellent for hospital access and regional reach.

## Overall Analysis
All three sites have strong highway proximity. Riyadh is best due to being on a major arterial with multiple expressway/ring interchanges within a few kilometers, offering redundancy and rapid citywide/regional access. Medina is very strong with immediate arterial frontage and fast links to the ring and intercity routes. NEOM/Sharma is close to Highway 5 but relies mainly on a single coastal corridor, which slightly lowers its score despite the short distance.

# Research Results for Criterion:

**Natural disaster risk level**

## RIYADH SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Riyadh (Al Aarid, King Abdulaziz Rd, 13331) lies on the Najd plateau in central Saudi Arabia, far from seismically active plate boundaries and the coast. Natural hazard profile: (1) Seismic: very low. Global/regional hazard maps place Riyadh in one of the lowest seismic zones in KSA, with indicative PGA (10% in 50 years) generally <0.04 g; no record of damaging local earthquakes. (2) Volcanic: none—no Quaternary volcanic fields nearby. (3) Flooding: exposed to occasional short‑duration, high‑intensity convective storms that can produce urban/flash flooding along wadis (e.g., Wadi Hanifah); several notable flood events have affected Riyadh in the past decade. Site elevation is high (~600–650 m a.s.l.) and inland, so no coastal flood/tsunami risk. (4) Sand/dust storms: frequent across central Arabia; operational impacts (visibility/air intakes) but typically non‑structural. (5) Extreme heat: summer highs commonly >45°C; heat waves are an operational hazard. (6) Landslide: negligible on the generally flat to gently undulating plateau, away from steep slopes.
- **Score:** 8.8/10
- **Explanation:** Riyadh has very low seismic and zero tsunami/volcanic risk, with only episodic flash‑flooding and pervasive heat/dust hazards to manage. From a natural‑disaster standpoint, it is the safest of the three; the score is slightly reduced for recurrent flash‑flood episodes in urban wadis and extreme heat.

## NEOM SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** NEOM/Sharma (269J+WJ, Tabuk Province) is on the Red Sea coast near the Gulf of Aqaba and the Dead Sea Transform—Saudi Arabia’s highest seismicity corridor. Natural hazard profile: (1) Seismic: moderate to elevated for KSA. The 1995 Gulf of Aqaba (M~7.2) earthquake occurred along this system and generated localized tsunami/wave effects in the gulf; regional models indicate coastal Tabuk/Aqaba PGA on the order of ~0.15–0.25 g (10% in 50 years), higher on soft coastal/alluvial ground. (2) Tsunami/coastal: low to moderate. The Red Sea has low tropical cyclone activity and small tides, but near‑field earthquake/landslide tsunamis in the Gulf of Aqaba are a credible, if infrequent, hazard; sea‑level rise will increase long‑term coastal flood exposure. (3) Flooding: high flash‑flood potential from steep coastal wadis draining the Hejaz mountains; short, intense storms can produce dangerous flows and debris floods on alluvial fans. (4) Landslide/rockfall: present along coastal escarpments and road cuts. (5) Volcanic: no local volcanic fields immediately adjacent, but far‑field basaltic fields exist elsewhere in western KSA (not a primary hazard here). (6) Sand/dust storms: periodic; (7) Extreme heat/humidity: high heat index due to maritime humidity.
- **Score:** 5.6/10
- **Explanation:** Proximity to the Dead Sea Transform/Gulf of Aqaba raises earthquake shaking levels and introduces rare but plausible tsunami risk; coastal setting adds sea‑level rise and liquefaction concerns on young sediments. Steep wadis elevate flash‑flood and debris‑flow risk. These combined hazards lower the score compared with the other sites.

## MEDINA SAUDI ARBIA
- **Data:** Medina (King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, 42312) lies on the western Arabian Shield, ~150–180 km east of the Red Sea coast. Natural hazard profile: (1) Seismic: low to moderate—higher than Riyadh but lower than the Aqaba coast; regional models indicate PGA roughly ~0.06–0.12 g (10% in 50 years) due to proximity to Red Sea rift/transform structures. (2) Volcanic: present. Medina borders the Harrat Rahat volcanic field, which last erupted in 1256 CE with basaltic lava flows that reached the outskirts of the city; the field is considered active on a Holocene timescale, implying low‑frequency but non‑zero future activity. (3) Flooding: subject to flash floods from convective storms and runoff from surrounding volcanic highlands and wadis; several damaging flood events have been recorded in the Medina region. (4) Tsunami/coastal: none at the site due to inland location. (5) Landslide: localized rockfall/debris flows possible along nearby slopes and wadi margins. (6) Sand/dust storms and extreme heat: frequent/high, as elsewhere in western KSA’s interior.
- **Score:** 6.7/10
- **Explanation:** Medina avoids coastal and tsunami hazards but carries moderate seismicity and a unique volcanic hazard from Harrat Rahat (historic eruption), plus recurrent flash‑flood exposure. Overall risk is moderate—worse than Riyadh but better than the Aqaba/NEOM coastal zone.

## Overall Analysis
Considering only natural‑disaster risk for hospital siting: Riyadh ranks best due to very low seismicity and no volcanic/tsunami exposure, with manageable flash‑flood and heat/dust risks. Medina is intermediate, with moderate seismicity and a credible but low‑frequency volcanic hazard plus flash floods. NEOM/Sharma ranks lowest because of elevated seismicity near the Dead Sea Transform, rare but plausible tsunami/coastal hazards, high flash‑flood potential from steep wadis, and coastal geotechnical concerns.

- **Score:** 8.5/10
- **Explanation:** Northern Riyadh has dense SRCA coverage, mature road network, and multiple EDs within 5–12 km, supporting 8–12 minute ambulance arrivals in most conditions. Peak congestion can extend times, but redundancy of routes and nearby facilities keeps risk moderate. Strong for hospital placement from an emergency response-time perspective.

## NEOM SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** {'address': '269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM, Saudi Arabia', 'context': 'Sharma area on the Red Sea coast within the NEOM development zone (Tabuk Province). Sparse existing urban fabric; rapidly developing infrastructure but currently low-density with long inter-facility distances.', 'nearest_ems/ambulance_bases': ['SRCA Tabuk Region has regional centers, but local Sharma/NEOM-area EMS bases are limited and spread out (as of recent public sources).', 'Local NEOM/contractor clinics may have on-site ambulances for projects; availability to the public varies.'], 'nearest hospitals/EDs (approx. road distance/time)': ['Duba General Hospital (Duba): ~95–120 km by road depending on exact Sharma point; ~70–90 minutes.', 'Al Wajh General Hospital (Al Wajh): ~160–200 km; ~120–150 minutes.', 'King Khalid Hospital (Tabuk city): ~230–260 km; ~160–200 minutes.'], 'transport/road factors impacting EMS': ['Primary coastal highways with generally good pavement but long stretches between settlements.', 'Limited traffic congestion but long distances dominate response times.', 'Helicopter/air ambulance occasionally used for remote/coastal incidents; availability/weather dependent.'], 'published EMS response context (rural Saudi Arabia)': ['In rural/remote zones, SRCA response times can exceed urban targets significantly due to distance and base dispersion; 20–40+ minutes to scene is common, longer for transport to definitive care.'], 'estimated emergency response time at this site': {'ambulance arrival (rural EMS)': '20–40 minutes or more depending on nearest active SRCA/onsite NEOM unit.', 'transport time to hospital ED': '70–120+ minutes by road to nearest general hospital (Duba).', 'air ambulance (if deployed)': 'Potentially 20–40 minutes dispatch-to-arrival under favorable conditions, but not guaranteed.'}}
- **Score:** 3.5/10
- **Explanation:** Current NEOM/Sharma area has sparse EMS basing and long distances to hospitals. While roads are uncongested and aerospace support may exist, predictable ambulance response is much slower than urban centers. From an emergency response-time perspective, it is weak now; it could improve as NEOM healthcare assets come online.

- **Score:** 8.0/10
- **Explanation:** Medina’s mature urban EMS coverage and multiple nearby EDs support typical 8–12 minute ambulance arrivals. Seasonal congestion can extend times somewhat more than in off-peak Riyadh corridors, but overall performance remains strong for hospital placement.

## Overall Analysis
For emergency response time, established urban corridors in Riyadh (Al Aarid/King Abdulaziz Rd) and Medina (King Abdullah Rd) offer reliable 8–12 minute ambulance arrivals with multiple EDs nearby; Riyadh edges Medina due to higher facility density and route redundancy in the immediate catchment. NEOM/Sharma is currently disadvantaged by long distances and sparse EMS basing, yielding slower and less predictable response. Scores: Riyadh 8.5, Medina 8.0, NEOM 3.5.

**Land cost per acre ($)**

## RIYADH SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Address context: RRDA4539 King Abdulaziz Road, Al Aarid, Riyadh 13331 (north Riyadh growth corridor).
What is being priced: serviced/freehold urban land suitable for a large institutional/commercial plot along or just off King Abdulaziz Rd in Al Aarid.
Observed market range (2024-2025): approximately SAR 3,000–5,000 per m2 for medium-to-large plots in Al Aarid and adjacent north Riyadh districts, based on public land listings and district price indices (Wasalt price index; Aqar/Bayut listings; Ministry of Justice transaction data trends for north Riyadh).
Conversion assumptions: 1 acre = 4,046.86 m2; FX 1 USD = 3.75 SAR (Saudi riyal peg).
Per-acre cost (SAR): ~12,140,580–20,234,300.
Per-acre cost (USD): ~3,237,000–5,396,000 (midpoint ~4,317,000).
Notes: Hospital-suitable frontage parcels on major arterials typically transact toward the upper end of the range; very large contiguous plots can sometimes negotiate a modest per-m2 discount, but prime-corridor commercial zoning often offsets that.
- **Score:** 3/10
- **Explanation:** Riyadh Al Aarid shows the highest land cost per acre among the three locations (~USD 3.24–5.40 million per acre). Given the criterion is land cost per acre (lower is better), this location ranks lowest.

## NEOM SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Address context: 269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM, Tabuk region (coastal area near the NEOM development zone).
What is being priced: privately tradable land in and around Sharma and nearby localities outside state-held NEOM core; note that much land in the NEOM footprint is state-controlled and allocated via government/NEOM Company, not open-market freehold sales.
Observed market range (2024-2025): approximately SAR 300–800 per m2 for coastal/proximate plots around Sharma/Tabuk coast where private listings exist (public listings and regional transaction chatter; Tabuk regional listings on Aqar/Haraj/Bayut; MoJ regional trends indicate materially lower price points than Riyadh/Madinah).
Conversion assumptions: 1 acre = 4,046.86 m2; FX 1 USD = 3.75 SAR.
Per-acre cost (SAR): ~1,214,058–3,237,488.
Per-acre cost (USD): ~324,000–863,000 (midpoint ~594,000).
Notes: Availability of large, hospital-suitable, fully serviced plots via freehold purchase is limited; inside the NEOM project area, land is typically accessed via government allocation/lease rather than purchase. Figures reflect private-market land where tradeable; on-arterial serviced parcels may be at or above the upper bound once utilities and access are factored.
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Explanation:** NEOM/Sharma area exhibits the lowest open-market land cost per acre (~USD 0.32–0.86 million per acre). Purely on the land-cost criterion (lower is better), it scores highest. Caveat: practical acquisition may rely on government allocation rather than purchase, but this does not change the unit-cost assessment.

## MEDINA SAUDI ARBIA
- **Data:** Address context: King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312 (eastern Madinah corridor).
What is being priced: urban land along/near King Abdullah Rd in Al Rayah suitable for institutional/commercial use.
Observed market range (2024-2025): approximately SAR 1,200–2,000 per m2 for serviced land in Al Rayah and adjacent districts along King Abdullah Rd, based on public listings and district price guides (Wasalt price index; Aqar/Bayut listings; Ministry of Justice city-level transaction indicators for Madinah).
Conversion assumptions: 1 acre = 4,046.86 m2; FX 1 USD = 3.75 SAR.
Per-acre cost (SAR): ~4,856,232–8,093,720.
Per-acre cost (USD): ~1,295,000–2,158,000 (midpoint ~1,727,000).
Notes: Parcels with strong frontage and commercial zoning trend to the upper half of the range; assembling larger contiguous acreage can secure modest per-m2 discounts away from prime frontages.
- **Score:** 6/10
- **Explanation:** Madinah Al Rayah is materially cheaper than north Riyadh but more expensive than Sharma/NEOM on a per-acre basis (~USD 1.30–2.16 million per acre). On the land-cost criterion, it ranks in the middle.

## Overall Analysis
On land cost per acre alone (USD), NEOM/Sharma is cheapest (score 9), Madinah Al Rayah is mid-priced (score 6), and Riyadh Al Aarid is most expensive (score 3). Ranges are derived from 2024-2025 public listing ranges and Saudi MoJ market trends, converted using 1 acre = 4,046.86 m2 and SAR 3.75/USD. For hospital planning, also validate zoning/servicing and whether land is available for purchase vs. government allocation (especially in NEOM), as these can affect total acquisition strategy even if unit land cost is low.

# Research Results for Criterion:

**Construction cost per sq ft ($)**

## RIYADH SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Riyadh (RRDA4539 King Abdulaziz Rd, Al Aarid) is Saudi Arabia’s largest construction market with the deepest contractor and supplier base, which generally keeps logistics costs lower than in remote regions but has seen strong price escalation under Vision 2030 demand. For a modern acute hospital (circa 250–500 beds, RC frame, 6–10 stories, high MEP intensity, medical gases, but excluding medical equipment, land, VAT, professional fees, financing, and major off-site infrastructure), current all-in building costs in 2024–2025 commonly tender in the range of about USD 230–320 per gross sq ft (≈ USD 2,475–3,445 per m²; ≈ SAR 9,280–12,920 per m² at 1 USD = 3.75 SAR). Drivers: abundant contractor competition and ready access to materials (cement, rebar, aggregates, MEP supply houses), offset by high market activity and wage/overhead premiums. Tender price inflation in Riyadh has been elevated since 2022 due to Vision 2030 programs. Assumes typical site access and no extraordinary foundation or phasing constraints.
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Mid-range cost within KSA: favorable supply chain and competition lower logistics costs, but high demand inflation in Riyadh keeps hospital $/sf above Medina. On a pure construction cost-per-sq-ft basis (lower is better), Riyadh is competitive but not the lowest-cost option.

## NEOM SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** NEOM (269J+WJ, Sharma, Tabuk Province) is a remote coastal location with controlled site access and developing infrastructure. Construction relies on long supply lines via Duba/Yanbu ports and NEOM Bay Airport, dedicated worker accommodation, and stringent logistics controls. These factors add a significant remote-area premium to preliminaries, logistics, and labor. For the same hospital specification, current all-in building costs are typically USD 280–400 per gross sq ft (≈ USD 3,015–4,305 per m²; ≈ SAR 11,300–16,100 per m² at 1 USD = 3.75 SAR). The range reflects remoteness, mobilization/camp costs, restricted delivery windows, and limited contractor competition compared with Riyadh/Jeddah/Medina. Assumes no extreme geotechnical risks and standard coastal corrosion protection allowances.
- **Score:** 4/10
- **Explanation:** Highest cost per sq ft of the three due to remoteness, logistics, and limited competitive tension. Even with some economies from large NEOM programs, premiums typically elevate hospital $/sf well above other Saudi urban centers.

## MEDINA SAUDI ARBIA
- **Data:** Medina (King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah) is a mature Western Region market with access to contractors and supply chains through Medina itself and nearby Yanbu/Jeddah ports. Demand is robust but generally less overheated than Riyadh, supporting more competitive tendering. For a comparable acute hospital, current all-in building costs commonly tender around USD 200–290 per gross sq ft (≈ USD 2,150–3,120 per m²; ≈ SAR 8,060–11,700 per m² at 1 USD = 3.75 SAR). Drivers: good material access (cement/rebar from Western producers), established MEP supply routes, and adequate contractor capacity, with lower logistics premiums than NEOM and slightly less demand-driven inflation than Riyadh. Excludes medical equipment, land, VAT, professional fees, and major off-site infrastructure.
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Explanation:** Lowest expected construction cost per sq ft among the three, benefiting from established Western Region supply chains and generally more competitive pricing than Riyadh, without the NEOM remoteness premium. Thus, it scores highest on the cost-per-sq-ft criterion.

## Overall Analysis
For the single criterion of construction cost per sq ft (lower is better), Medina is the most cost-efficient, Riyadh is mid, and NEOM is the most expensive due to remoteness/logistics. Recommended planning allowances (building only, excluding land/equipment/fees/VAT) are: Medina ≈ USD 200–290/sf; Riyadh ≈ USD 230–320/sf; NEOM ≈ USD 280–400/sf. Actual outcomes depend on project complexity, procurement strategy, and market timing; applying a ±15–20% sensitivity during early planning is prudent.

**Median age of population**

## RIYADH SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Saudi Arabia’s national median age is approximately 30–31 years (2023–2024 estimates). Riyadh, as the capital and largest city, has a disproportionately young population driven by internal migration and expatriate labor. Available Saudi demographic surveys show the Kingdom’s age structure is youth-skewed (large 20–39 cohort). City-specific median-age data are not officially published, but Riyadh’s median age is commonly inferred to be slightly below the national median due to its concentration of working-age adults and families. Neighborhood Al Aarid (north Riyadh) has rapid real estate development oriented to young families and professionals.
- **Score:** 8/10
- **Explanation:** For hospital placement under the median-age criterion, a younger median age implies high volumes of maternity, pediatrics, trauma, and elective/same-day needs, but less age-driven chronic/geriatric burden. Riyadh’s likely median age slightly below the national figure supports sustained demand across young-adult and family services. It scores high because the age mix suggests broad service needs and long-term growth, though it is not optimal for geriatric-heavy service lines.

## NEOM SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** NEOM/Sharma is a nascent development zone on the Red Sea with a small resident base dominated by project workforce (primarily working-age adults, largely 20–49). The area’s current median age is expected to be low due to the project-based, expatriate-heavy composition and minimal presence of retirees/elderly. There is no official city-level median age published for NEOM; demographic structure is inferred from workforce-led population and limited permanent family settlement to date.
- **Score:** 6/10
- **Explanation:** A low median age suggests demand concentrated in occupational health, emergency/trauma, and maternity only as family population grows. Current youth-skew and small base population reduce immediate hospital-level demand by median age alone. Score reflects favorable young-age profile for certain services but limited depth in older-age cohorts that drive inpatient and chronic-care volumes today.

## MEDINA SAUDI ARBIA
- **Data:** Madinah (Medina) is one of Saudi Arabia’s major cities with significant internal migration and a steady influx of pilgrims. Nationally, the median age is ~30–31 years, and Madinah’s resident population skews young to working-age similar to other Saudi urban centers, but with an additional transient older adult component due to pilgrimage visitors. City-specific median age is not officially published; however, resident demographics are consistent with a youthful national age structure, with some uplift in older-age care needs from visiting pilgrims.
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Resident median age is likely close to or slightly below the national median, supporting demand for maternal-child and adult acute services. Pilgrimage traffic introduces episodic increases in older adult presence, modestly enhancing age-driven acuity and chronic-care demand relative to purely young cities. Thus, median-age considerations are favorable but somewhat less consistently geriatric-heavy than locations with older resident populations.

## Overall Analysis
All three Saudi locations sit within a relatively young national age structure (~30–31 median). Riyadh likely trends slightly younger due to its large working-age base; NEOM/Sharma is the youngest but with a small resident base; Madinah is youthful but experiences episodic older-age demand with pilgrimage. Under the single criterion of median age, Riyadh scores highest (8) for a strong, sustained young-adult/family base; Madinah (7) benefits from pilgrimage-related older-age demand; NEOM (6) is youngest but has limited immediate age-driven hospital demand due to its nascent, workforce-centric population.

  - **Population density (people per sq km)**
    - **location_1**
      - **data**
          Riyadh (Al Aarid, King Abdulaziz Rd). Latest official city-level density: ~3,891 people/km² (2022 Census population ≈ 7,676,654; administrative city area ≈ 1,973 km²). Al Aarid is a rapidly urbanizing northern district within the built-up urban area, implying medium-to-high local residential density consistent with city averages. Sources: Saudi 2022 Census (GASTAT) for population; ArRiyadh Development Authority/Widely cited municipal figures for area.
      - **score**
          9
      - **explanation**
          High urban population density and ongoing residential development yield a large immediate catchment, making the site very favorable for hospital placement when density is the criterion.
    - **location_2**
      - **data**
          NEOM/Sharma (269J+WJ, Tabuk Province). Current surrounding density is very low. Provincial reference: Tabuk Region density ≈ 7 people/km² (2022 population ≈ 1.0 million; area ≈ 146,000 km²). The immediate Sharma/NEOM coastal area remains sparsely populated with small settlements and construction camps; present local density is likely below the provincial average. Sources: Saudi 2022 Census (GASTAT) for regional population; widely cited provincial area figures; NEOM is a developing zone with limited current residency.
      - **score**
          1
      - **explanation**
          Extremely low current population density means a small resident catchment for a hospital at present, despite long-term development plans.
    - **location_3**
      - **data**
          Madinah (King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah). City-level density: ~2,528 people/km² (2022 Census population ≈ 1,488,782; city administrative area ≈ 589 km²). The site is within the built-up urban fabric along a major corridor, indicating moderate-to-high local density relative to city averages. Sources: Saudi 2022 Census (GASTAT) for population; commonly cited municipal area for Medina.
      - **score**
          8
      - **explanation**
          Substantial urban population density provides a strong resident catchment. While lower than Riyadh’s overall density, it is still favorable for hospital placement on a density basis.
    - **overall_analysis**
        On current population density alone: Riyadh (Al Aarid) ranks best (≈3,891/km²), Madinah is strong but lower (≈2,528/km²), and NEOM/Sharma is currently very sparse (≈7/km² regionally; local likely lower). Thus, Location 1 > Location 3 >> Location 2 for immediate hospital demand based on resident density.
  - **Median age of population**
    - **location_1**
      - **data**
          Address: RRDA4539 King Abdulaziz Rd, Al Aarid, Riyadh 13331, Saudi Arabia (Riyadh city, Riyadh Region). Best-available age statistics: Saudi Arabia’s median age is in the low 30s in the early 2020s per United Nations World Population Prospects; the country has a youthful structure among nationals and a large working-age expatriate segment. Riyadh Region (which includes Riyadh city) has one of the highest concentrations of working‑age expatriates in the Kingdom, which shifts the age profile toward adults (25–44) and generally yields a higher median age than many non-metropolitan regions. Riyadh city itself is highly urbanized with fewer children per household than rural areas, further nudging the median age upward relative to the national average of a decade ago. Sources: UN World Population Prospects (https://population.un.org/wpp/); Saudi 2022 Census – General Authority for Statistics regional profiles (https://www.stats.gov.sa/).
      - **score**
          8
      - **explanation**
          Scored higher because, relative to other Saudi regions, Riyadh’s population skews more to working‑age adults and somewhat older median age than peripheral regions, implying greater immediate demand for hospital services (chronic disease management, surgical volumes) than a younger region. While still young compared with many OECD cities, Riyadh is older than Tabuk/NEOM and likely modestly older than Madinah.
    - **location_2**
      - **data**
          Address: 269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM, Saudi Arabia (Tabuk Region, northwest coast). Best-available age statistics: National median age is in the low 30s (UN WPP). The NEOM/Sharma area’s current resident base is small and dominated by project/workforce populations in working ages (largely 20s–40s), with comparatively few elderly residents. Tabuk Region overall is less urbanized than Riyadh and historically has a younger age structure (higher fertility among Saudi nationals and a smaller proportion of long‑term elderly residents). Sources: UN World Population Prospects (https://population.un.org/wpp/); Saudi 2022 Census regional reporting for Tabuk (https://www.stats.gov.sa/).
      - **score**
          5
      - **explanation**
          Scored lower on median‑age criterion because the present age mix in the NEOM/Sharma catchment is heavily working‑age with very limited older population, implying lower near‑term age‑driven hospital demand (e.g., for geriatric, CV, oncology admissions) compared with Riyadh and Madinah. As NEOM matures and attracts families/retirees, the score could rise.
    - **location_3**
      - **data**
          Address: King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312, Saudi Arabia (Madinah city, Madinah Region). Best-available age statistics: Saudi Arabia’s national median age is in the low 30s (UN WPP). Madinah Region’s resident population includes both young Saudi nationals and a substantial working‑age expatriate segment but is generally younger than Riyadh’s overall age profile. Pilgrimage influx raises the number of elderly visitors seasonally, but visitors do not change the resident median age. Sources: UN World Population Prospects (https://population.un.org/wpp/); Saudi 2022 Census regional profiles (https://www.stats.gov.sa/).
      - **score**
          6
      - **explanation**
          Scored in the middle: Madinah’s resident median age is likely younger than Riyadh’s but older than remote Tabuk/NEOM areas because of its urban character and expatriate workforce. Seasonal elderly visitors increase episodic care needs but do not affect resident median age; thus, on a pure median‑age basis it ranks between Riyadh and NEOM.
    - **overall_analysis**
        Exact median age at neighborhood/city level is not officially published; the best-available measures are national and regional age structures. Using those, Riyadh is likely to have the oldest median age among the three due to its large, urban, working‑age and somewhat older adult mix, followed by Madinah, with NEOM/Sharma the youngest (project‑workforce dominated). For hospital placement on a median‑age criterion alone (older = stronger near‑term demand), Riyadh ranks best, Madinah moderate, NEOM lower pending future demographic maturation.
  - **Average household income ($)**
    - **location_1**
      - **data**
          Riyadh (Al Aarid district, 13331). Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Statistics (GASTAT) reports that the average monthly household income in the Riyadh administrative region is among the highest nationally. In the 2018 Household Income and Expenditure Survey, Riyadh’s average monthly household income was reported at approximately SAR 13,400–14,000 per household, higher than most other regions. Using the Saudi riyal’s long‑standing peg (≈ SAR 3.75 = USD 1), this is roughly USD 3,570–3,730 per month (USD ~42,800–44,800 per year). Riyadh also has the country’s highest concentration of high‑income and expatriate professional households, particularly in fast‑growing northern districts like Al Aarid (King Abdulaziz Rd corridor), which typically over-index relative to the region-wide average.
      - **score**
          9
      - **explanation**
          Within Saudi Arabia, Riyadh has the highest household earning power and payer mix depth, which is favorable for hospital revenue capture (private insurance/self-pay). Northern Riyadh districts such as Al Aarid skew higher than the regional mean, making this location highly attractive on the income criterion alone.
    - **location_2**
      - **data**
          NEOM (Sharma, Tabuk Province). Current household income in NEOM/Sharma is not yet representative of a mature resident market; the area is under phased development. Tabuk region’s average monthly household income (GASTAT 2018) trails Riyadh and Madinah, commonly cited near SAR 10,000–11,500 per month, equating to roughly USD 2,670–3,070 per month (USD ~32,000–36,800 per year) at the SAR 3.75 = USD 1 peg. While NEOM’s future resident profile is planned to be high-income, present-day permanent household base in Sharma/NEOM remains small and mixed (construction/transient workforce).
      - **score**
          6
      - **explanation**
          On the income criterion today, the broader Tabuk region’s household income is mid-range. NEOM’s long-term plans point to a higher-income population, but current local household income depth is limited, tempering immediate hospital revenue potential.
    - **location_3**
      - **data**
          Madinah (Al Rayah, 42312). GASTAT data indicate Madinah region’s average monthly household income sits above many regions but below Riyadh, typically around SAR 11,500–12,500 per month, or roughly USD 3,070–3,330 per month (USD ~36,800–40,000 per year) at SAR 3.75 = USD 1. Madinah’s economy also benefits from religious tourism and service sectors, with mixed-income resident neighborhoods; central and north-central corridors along King Abdullah Rd host middle to upper‑middle income households supporting private healthcare demand.
      - **score**
          7
      - **explanation**
          Madinah’s household income is solid but generally below Riyadh’s, yielding good—though not top-tier—ability to pay for hospital services. Tourism seasonality and a broad middle-income base support steady demand but with slightly lower revenue intensity than northern Riyadh.
    - **overall_analysis**
        Based solely on average household income, Riyadh (Al Aarid) is strongest, reflecting Saudi Arabia’s highest-earning households and a premium payer mix. Madinah is mid-to-high, supporting viable private hospital economics but below Riyadh’s ceiling. NEOM/Sharma’s current household income base aligns with Tabuk’s mid-range profile; while future NEOM demographics may be high-income, present-day local incomes and resident depth are still developing.
  - **Annual population growth rate (%)**
    - **location_1**
      - **data**
          Riyadh (capital and largest city) sits in Riyadh Region, which has been the fastest-growing region in Saudi Arabia. GASTAT’s 2022 demographic survey shows Riyadh Region accounted for ~26% of the Kingdom’s population and is the primary net in‑migration destination. Nationally, GASTAT reported very rapid population growth between 2022 and 2023 (from 32.2m to 34.8m; ~7.9% year-over-year) mainly due to a rebound in expatriate inflows, while Saudi nationals grew ~1.7–2.0% annually. Riyadh city specifically has long exhibited above‑average growth due to internal migration and major economic programs (e.g., Vision 2030, Riyadh metro, mega‑projects), with multiple government announcements targeting the city’s population to reach 15–20 million by 2030–2035 (implying mid‑single‑digit annual growth if realized). While precise city‑level annual growth rates are not published annually by GASTAT, triangulation from recent GASTAT releases and official targets indicates Riyadh’s current effective growth (population present/served, including expatriates) is in the high single digits in 2023 off a migration surge, normalizing toward ~3–4% in the medium term as inflows stabilize.
      - **score**
          9
      - **explanation**
          High and sustained population growth (driven by migration, economic expansion, and government programs) increases future hospital demand. Even allowing for normalization after the 2023 surge, Riyadh’s medium‑term growth outlook is among the strongest in the Kingdom, supporting a high score on this criterion alone.
    - **location_2**
      - **data**
          NEOM (in Tabuk Province, near Sharma) is a new greenfield development with minimal permanent resident base today. Tabuk Province’s total population is much smaller than Riyadh or Madinah and historically grows at a moderate rate (roughly ~1–2% per year for Saudi nationals, with expatriate fluctuations). NEOM’s official plans target up to 1–9 million residents by 2045–2050 (varies by phase), but current occupancy is primarily project staff/contractors, with phased habitation still ramping. Thus, current realized annual population growth at the site is low in absolute numbers from a very small base, though planned growth is high and volatile, dependent on project phasing and funding.
      - **score**
          5
      - **explanation**
          Projected growth is very high, but present, verifiable annual population growth at the site is low due to the nascent resident base. For this criterion (actual annual growth), NEOM scores mid‑range: upside exists, but near‑term certainty is lower than established cities.
    - **location_3**
      - **data**
          Madinah (Al Madinah Al Munawwarah) is a major Saudi city and pilgrimage hub. GASTAT data show the Madinah Region accounts for roughly 8–9% of the national population. Saudi nationals’ natural increase is steady (~1.5–2% annually), and expatriate inflows have recovered post‑pandemic, lifting overall growth. While not as migration‑driven as Riyadh, Madinah city’s population trend is positive, supported by religious tourism expansion (e.g., post‑pandemic recovery) and urban development plans, implying an overall annual growth rate around ~2–3% in the medium term.
      - **score**
          7
      - **explanation**
          Madinah exhibits steady, moderate population growth. It lacks Riyadh’s surge from economic in‑migration but maintains consistent demand growth tied to residents and pilgrims. On this criterion, it ranks above a greenfield like NEOM (today) but below Riyadh.
    - **overall_analysis**
        On the specific criterion of annual population growth rate: Riyadh leads due to strong net in‑migration and economic momentum (score 9). Madinah shows solid, steady growth (score 7). NEOM’s long‑term plan suggests high future growth, but current realized growth from a small base is limited and uncertain (score 5). These scores reflect present and medium‑term demographic dynamics affecting hospital demand growth.
  - **Chronic disease prevalence rate (%)**
    - **location_1**
      - **data**
          Riyadh Region (includes Al Aarid, Riyadh 13331): Chronic disease risk factor and disease prevalence in Saudi adults remains among the highest nationally. National surveys report diabetes prevalence ~18–19% in adults (WHO STEPS KSA 2019; MoH), obesity ~35–38% (higher in central regions including Riyadh), and hypertension ~26–28%. Urban centers such as Riyadh show higher obesity and diabetes burdens versus many peripheral regions. These rates translate to substantial demand for chronic disease management services (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease), especially given Riyadh’s large and growing adult population base.
      - **score**
          9
      - **explanation**
          Higher chronic disease prevalence in urban Riyadh paired with very large catchment population implies strong and sustained need for hospital-based chronic care (endocrinology, cardiology, renal services). On this single criterion (prevalence), a higher burden indicates greater service demand; therefore Riyadh scores high.
    - **location_2**
      - **data**
          NEOM (Sharma, Tabuk Province): Current resident population is comparatively low, but situated within Tabuk Province, where adult NCD burdens mirror national levels: diabetes roughly ~15–17%, obesity ~30–35%, and hypertension ~24–26% based on national/regional estimates. However, the immediate NEOM/Sharma population is still small; thus absolute numbers of chronic disease cases are lower today despite moderate prevalence. NEOM’s planned growth could increase future chronic disease service demand.
      - **score**
          5
      - **explanation**
          Estimated chronic disease prevalence is moderate (similar to national averages), but the present population base in NEOM/Sharma remains limited, yielding fewer absolute chronic cases today. On prevalence alone, it is not low, but demand is constrained by scale. Future growth could raise need, but on current prevalence-driven utility, it is mid-range.
    - **location_3**
      - **data**
          Madinah Region (includes King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312): Western-region data indicate adult diabetes prevalence ~18–20%, obesity ~33–37%, and hypertension ~25–28%, comparable to or slightly above national averages. Madinah city serves residents and large volumes of visitors/pilgrims who have notable NCD burdens, increasing the real-world load of chronic conditions requiring acute and longitudinal management.
      - **score**
          8
      - **explanation**
          Chronic disease prevalence is high and comparable to Riyadh, and the city’s role as a religious destination increases the volume of adults with NCDs needing care. On the prevalence criterion, this translates into strong and steady demand for hospital-based chronic disease services.
    - **overall_analysis**
        All three locations have high chronic disease prevalence typical of Saudi Arabia, driven by obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Riyadh and Madinah show the highest anticipated need due to high prevalence combined with large, dense populations—Riyadh slightly higher for hospital placement on this criterion. NEOM/Sharma likely has similar prevalence but a much smaller current population base, reducing immediate chronic case volumes despite future growth potential.
  - **Proximity to major highways (km)**
    - **location_1**
      - **data**
          Address: King Abdulaziz Rd, Al Aarid, Riyadh 13331. This corridor is a major north–south arterial in northern Riyadh. Nearest grade‑separated expressways: King Salman Rd (a regional ring/expressway) ≈1.0–1.5 km north; Northern Ring Rd (Route 30) ≈6–8 km south; Route 65 (Riyadh–Qassim Expressway/King Fahd Rd) ≈5–7 km west; Airport Expressway (Route 539/King Khalid Rd) ≈7–9 km east. Practical nearest major highway access is via King Salman Rd at ≈1–1.5 km.
      - **score**
          9
      - **explanation**
          Very close (≈1–1.5 km) to King Salman Rd, providing rapid regional access, and within 5–9 km of several other primary expressways (R65, Northern Ring, Airport Expy). This proximity supports efficient patient, staff, and logistics access with multiple route redundancies. Minor deduction for being on an urban arterial rather than directly frontage to a motorway (potential local congestion).
    - **location_2**
      - **data**
          Address: 269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM (Tabuk Province). The Sharma/NEOM coastal zone is served primarily by Highway 5 (Route 5) running along the Red Sea coast. The 269J+WJ Plus Code plots near Sharma; the nearest junction with Highway 5 is approximately 2–4 km (depending on the exact plot within the Plus Code area). Nearest other major routes are far (hundreds of km); Highway 5 is the main regional artery linking to Duba and Haql.
      - **score**
          7
      - **explanation**
          Proximity to a single major highway (Route 5) is good (≈2–4 km), giving coastal regional access, but redundancy is limited and distances to other expressways/urban rings are very large. Emerging infrastructure in NEOM may improve this, but current network density is low compared with major cities.
    - **location_3**
      - **data**
          Address: King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312. King Abdullah Rd is a principal east–west urban expressway in Madinah with grade separations that links directly to Route 60 (Madinah–Yanbu Highway) on the west and Route 15 (Hijrah Rd) to the south/east via interchanges. Distance to Route 60: ≈2–3 km west; distance to Route 15: ≈4–6 km south/east. The corridor itself functions as a major expressway inside the city.
      - **score**
          8
      - **explanation**
          Located on or immediately adjacent to a city expressway with quick access (≈2–6 km) to two national highways (R60 and R15), offering strong regional connectivity. Slightly less redundancy and scale than northern Riyadh’s multi‑expressway hub, but still very favorable.
    - **overall_analysis**
        All three sites are close to major highways. Riyadh Al Aarid is best, with immediate access (≈1–1.5 km) to King Salman Rd and multiple other expressways within 5–9 km, supporting superior regional connectivity and redundancy. Madinah’s King Abdullah Rd site is also strong, effectively on an urban expressway with short links to R60 and R15. The NEOM/Sharma site is near Highway 5 (≈2–4 km) but lacks alternative major routes, reducing redundancy despite acceptable proximity.
  - **Public transportation accessibility score**
    - **location_1**
      - **data**
          Address: RRDA4539 King Abdulaziz Road, Al Aarid, Riyadh 13331, Saudi Arabia. Public transport context: Riyadh operates the citywide Riyadh Bus network (launched in phases since March 2023 by the Royal Commission for Riyadh City), which serves major arterials including King Abdulaziz Road in the north of the city; stops are typically spaced for walk-up access along the corridor. The King Abdulaziz Road corridor is also designated for a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line under the King Abdulaziz Public Transport Project (part of Riyadh’s integrated metro + BRT program). The Riyadh Metro (6-line network under the same project) is planned to interconnect with bus/BRT; stations nearest to Al Aarid will be several kilometers to the south when rail service opens, so near-term access relies on buses/BRT. References: Riyadh Bus official info and network updates (https://riyadhbus.sa/en); Royal Commission for Riyadh City – Public Transport Program and BRT/Metro project pages (https://www.rcrc.gov.sa/en/projects/public-transport).
      - **score**
          7
      - **explanation**
          Strengths: On-corridor service on King Abdulaziz Road via the operational Riyadh Bus network, with planned dedicated BRT on the same corridor, provides relatively good public transport accessibility for staff, patients, and visitors. The corridor is a major north–south spine with frequent service and multiple stop options within walking distance for a site fronting King Abdulaziz Road. Constraints: Citywide rail (metro) access in this northern district is not yet in public operation; the nearest rail nodes are several kilometers away. Pedestrian crossing of wide arterials can add friction to first/last‑mile access. Overall, good present-day bus access with strong upside once BRT/metro phases complete, but not the city’s highest PT accessibility today.

          Address: 269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM, Saudi Arabia. Public transport context: NEOM/Sharma currently has no municipal public transport network in general public operation (no urban bus or rail). NEOM’s long‑term mobility plan centers on car‑free urbanism and high‑capacity transit (e.g., THE LINE’s spine rail), but these systems are under development and not available for public use yet. Regional connectivity is primarily by road. The nearest airport is NEOM Bay Airport (IATA: NUM) near Sharma; air service is limited and not a substitute for local public transit. Intercity buses (SAPTCO) serve larger regional cities such as Tabuk and Duba; the nearest intercity bus hubs are roughly 90–100 km (Duba) and 160–180 km (Tabuk) by road from Sharma, with no established local feeder transit in NEOM for the general public. References: NEOM mobility concepts and project information (https://www.neom.com); SAPTCO intercity services (https://www.saptco.com.sa).
      - **score**
          1
      - **explanation**
          The site currently lacks local public transport (no city bus or rail) and relies on private vehicles or project-operated shuttles. Intercity bus and the nearby airport do not provide practical daily access for patients or staff without local feeders. While future NEOM transit is planned, it is not available for near- to medium-term operations. Score reflects very limited present-day public transport accessibility.

          Address: King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312, Saudi Arabia. Public transport context: Madinah has an urban bus network (“Madinah Buses”/city buses operated under the Transport General Authority and local operators, including SAPTCO) serving principal corridors such as King Abdullah Road with multiple city routes and signed stops. The city is also served by the Haramain High-Speed Railway (Al Madinah Station), which connects Madinah with Jeddah and Makkah; the rail station is located on the eastern side of the city and is approximately 8–10 km by road from the Al Rayah/King Abdullah Rd area, offering strong regional—but not local—public transport connectivity. Local circulator and seasonal shuttle services operate around the central area during peak pilgrimage periods, improving coverage but with variable schedules outside peak seasons. References: SAPTCO city services (https://www.saptco.com.sa); Saudi public transport program information (Transport General Authority: https://tga.gov.sa); Haramain High-Speed Railway information (Saudi Arabia Railways: https://www.sar.com.sa/en).
      - **score**
          5
      - **explanation**
          Strengths: Established city bus services along King Abdullah Road provide walk-up access to multiple routes; the city benefits from regional rail (Haramain HSR) for intercity trips. Constraints: Bus service levels (frequency/span) vary by route and season; there is no urban rail. First/last‑mile conditions along wide arterials can be a barrier. Overall, moderate public transport accessibility suitable for a hospital with bus-dependent access, but less robust than a site adjacent to a rail/BRT hub.
    - **overall_analysis**
        For public transportation accessibility alone, Location 1 (Riyadh, King Abdulaziz Rd) ranks best due to active city bus service on the corridor today and planned BRT/metro integration, offering good current access and strong future upside. Location 3 (Madinah, King Abdullah Rd) is moderate, with established city buses and regional rail nearby but no urban rail. Location 2 (NEOM/Sharma) scores very low due to the absence of an operational local public transport network at present.
  - **Emergency response time (minutes)**
    - **location_1**
      - **data**
          Riyadh (Al Aarid district, King Abdulaziz Rd, 13331) is within the built-up urban north of Riyadh, adjacent to major arterials (King Abdulaziz Rd, proximity to Northern Ring Rd and King Salman Rd). The Saudi Red Crescent Authority (SRCA) operates multiple ambulance centers across Riyadh, and the city hosts numerous tertiary hospitals (e.g., King Abdullah Specialist Children’s Hospital, King Fahd Medical City, King Saud Medical City). In dense Riyadh districts, practical ambulance response times commonly range about 8–15 minutes depending on time-of-day congestion; peak-hour congestion is significant on main corridors. The location is near multiple graded intersections and wide arterials that facilitate ambulance priority travel. Urban signalization and heavy traffic can add several minutes during peaks, but availability of nearby EMS units and hospitals generally keeps door-to-ER times relatively short compared with non-urban areas.
      - **score**
          8
      - **explanation**
          Urban EMS coverage with multiple nearby SRCA stations and hospitals supports faster ambulance arrival and transport, typically within roughly 8–15 minutes in practice for central/northern Riyadh. Peak congestion on major corridors is a limiting factor, preventing a 9–10 score.
    - **location_2**
      - **data**
          NEOM (Sharma area, 269J+WJ, 49626) is a developing coastal area in Tabuk Province with dispersed population and ongoing construction. Existing permanent hospitals and SRCA ambulance density are markedly lower than in major cities. Long inter-facility distances and limited secondary/tertiary roads mean ambulance response and transport times are often extended. While NEOM has been ramping up healthcare and onsite medical/industrial clinics for projects, the spatial spread and lower baseline EMS station density typically result in longer response intervals than urban cores. Off-peak traffic is light, but distances to comprehensive emergency care are significant.
      - **score**
          3
      - **explanation**
          Sparse EMS/hospital network and long distances in a developing area lead to longer response and transport times. Although roads are uncongested, the low density of stations and hospitals materially increases minutes-to-arrival and time-to-definitive care.
    - **location_3**
      - **data**
          Madinah (King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, 42312) is within the urban fabric of Madinah near major arterials (King Abdullah Rd), with established hospitals (e.g., King Fahd Hospital, Ohud Hospital, King Salman Medical City) and SRCA ambulance coverage. Madinah experiences seasonal surges in demand during Hajj/Ramadan, but road networks and EMS surge-capacity planning typically maintain urban response ranges similar to other Saudi cities. Typical urban ambulance arrival is often around 8–15 minutes depending on traffic and time of day; congestion is moderate compared with Riyadh, and key hospitals are within short drive distance from this corridor.
      - **score**
          7
      - **explanation**
          Urban EMS and hospital proximity support acceptable response times, likely comparable to other mid-to-large Saudi cities. Seasonal pilgrimage peaks and occasional congestion lower reliability compared with Riyadh’s year-round resources, but overall urban access remains good.
    - **overall_analysis**
        For emergency response time, urban settings with dense EMS and hospital networks outperform remote or developing areas. Location 1 (Riyadh) ranks highest due to extensive SRCA coverage and multiple nearby hospitals despite congestion. Location 3 (Madinah) is strong but subject to seasonal demand surges. Location 2 (NEOM/Sharma) currently has sparse EMS and hospital density, leading to longer response and transport times; this may improve as NEOM expands healthcare infrastructure.
  - **Land cost per acre ($)**
    - **location_1**
      - **data**
          Riyadh – Al Aarid District, King Abdulaziz Rd (13331). Market asking prices for commercially-suitable land along/near King Abdulaziz Road in Al Aarid are among the highest in Riyadh. Observed 2024–2025 listing ranges: about SAR 3,500–5,500 per sqm for prime commercial frontage, with interior secondary plots typically SAR 2,500–3,500 per sqm. Converted to cost per acre (1 acre = 4,046.856 sqm): SAR ~14.16–22.26 million per acre for prime frontage. At the SAR–USD peg (3.75 SAR per USD), that is approximately USD $3.78–$5.94 million per acre (midpoint ~USD $4.86 million). Notes: price varies by frontage width, access, zoning classification (commercial vs. mixed-use), and plot size; transaction prices can differ from asks.
      - **score**
          3
      - **explanation**
          For the land cost criterion alone, Al Aarid on King Abdulaziz Rd has very high unit land prices in Riyadh, making land acquisition capital-intensive. Relative to the other two locations, its per‑acre cost is the highest, hence a lower score.
    - **location_2**
      - **data**
          NEOM area – Sharma (269J+WJ). Private freehold acquisition within NEOM’s core is constrained; land for institutional uses is commonly allocated/leased via government/NEOM rather than open-market purchase. In the surrounding Sharma/Tabuk coastal hinterland (outside restricted NEOM zones), observed raw-land asks (2024–2025) for large tracts generally range ~SAR 100–400 per sqm depending on proximity to the coast, access, and services. Converted to cost per acre: SAR ~0.405–1.619 million per acre, which is approximately USD $0.108–$0.432 million per acre at the SAR peg (midpoint ~USD $0.216 million). Notes: where acquisition is via government allocation in NEOM, the effective land cost to the hospital sponsor may be negotiated (potentially far below open‑market equivalents), but market comparables in the adjacent area remain much lower than major metros.
      - **score**
          9
      - **explanation**
          Purely on land cost per acre, the NEOM/Sharma hinterland has substantially lower market land values than Riyadh and Madinah. Even accounting for NEOM’s allocation model (which can reduce or restructure land cost), the effective or comparable per‑acre cost is lowest among the three, warranting a high score.
    - **location_3**
      - **data**
          Madinah – Al Rayah, King Abdullah Rd (42312). Urban arterial corridor with established services. Observed 2024–2025 asking ranges for commercially-suitable plots along/near King Abdullah Rd and comparable arterials in Madinah: roughly SAR 1,500–3,000 per sqm, depending on frontage, access, and permitted use. Converted to cost per acre: SAR ~6.07–12.14 million per acre, or approximately USD $1.62–$3.24 million per acre at the SAR peg (midpoint ~USD $2.37 million). Notes: prices vary by plot geometry, corner status, and proximity to major intersections and healthcare clusters; transactions can clear below ask.
      - **score**
          6
      - **explanation**
          For land cost only, Madinah’s King Abdullah Rd corridor is materially cheaper per acre than Riyadh’s Al Aarid/King Abdulaziz Rd, but higher than NEOM/Sharma raw land. It therefore ranks in the middle on the cost criterion.
    - **overall_analysis**
        On the single criterion of land cost per acre (USD), NEOM/Sharma offers the lowest comparable costs (or negotiated allocations), followed by Madinah’s King Abdullah Rd corridor, with Riyadh Al Aarid on King Abdulaziz Rd being the most expensive. Scores reflect a simple inverse relationship to estimated per‑acre costs. Caveats: Saudi land markets are highly location- and zoning-specific; NEOM often uses allocation/lease mechanisms rather than freehold sales; and advertised asking prices may differ from closed transaction values. Verify current quotes with local brokers and authorities before acquisition.
  - **Construction cost per sq ft ($)**
    - **location_1**
      - **data**
          Address: RRDA4539 King Abdulaziz Road, Al Aarid, Riyadh 13331, Saudi Arabia. Scope/assumptions: Acute general hospital, mid-to-high healthcare specification (JCI-compliant), building-only cost (structure, architectural, MEP, vertical transportation, normal on-plot siteworks); excludes land, design/professional fees, finance, owner FF&E/IT/medical equipment, and VAT (15%). Price basis: Q3 2025 dollars. Indicative construction cost (Riyadh market): 2,400–3,100 USD/m² (≈223–288 USD/ft²). Rationale and local factors: Riyadh is KSA’s largest construction market with strong competition among Tier-1 contractors, mature healthcare supply chain, and ready access to domestic cement/steel; however, giga-project activity (Diriyah Gate, Qiddiya, ROSHN, metro expansions) and strong private development keep tender prices elevated versus secondary cities. Inland logistics add overland haul from ports (e.g., ~400–450 km from Dammam/Jubail; ~950 km from Jeddah), partially offset by plentiful local batching plants and fabrication. Codes/standards: Saudi Building Code (SBC, IBC-based) and Ministry of Health/Health Facility Guidelines typically adopted; Riyadh’s relatively low seismicity compared to western KSA keeps structural premiums modest. Market context: Multiple international cost benchmarks (e.g., Arcadis ICC 2024/2025, Turner & Townsend ICMS 2024/2025 Middle East) show Saudi Arabia as cost-competitive globally with mid-single-digit annual escalation in 2023–2025; hospitals carry higher MEP density and infection-control fit-out costs than commercial buildings. The above range reflects current Riyadh tendering conditions and healthcare complexity.
      - **score**
          7
      - **explanation**
          Riyadh benefits from a deep contractor/subcontractor market and robust supply chains, which contain risk and keep costs competitive; however, persistent market heat and inland logistics push hospital construction costs above the lowest-cost Saudi locations. On the cost-only criterion, it is mid-to-good (not best) among the three.
    - **location_2**
      - **data**
          Address: 269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM, Saudi Arabia (Tabuk Region, Red Sea coast). Scope/assumptions: Acute general hospital, mid-to-high healthcare specification (building-only as defined for Location 1), VAT excluded; Q3 2025 dollars. Indicative construction cost (NEOM/Sharma area): 2,900–4,000 USD/m² (≈269–372 USD/ft²). Rationale and local factors: NEOM is an active giga-project zone with stringent site security, remote-worker accommodation requirements, and constrained on-site infrastructure/utilities during build-out—driving higher preliminaries, logistics, and productivity losses. While proximity to the Red Sea and the upgraded Port of NEOM (formerly Duba Port) improves seaborne material access, the local subcontractor base is thinner than in Riyadh/Jeddah/Madinah and competition for skilled labor/equipment is intense, raising margins and risk allowances. Western KSA’s higher seismic design categories versus Riyadh can add structural cost for essential facilities. Industry reporting in 2023–2025 notes capacity constraints and cost pressure across Saudi giga-projects; remote-site premiums of roughly +15–35% above tier‑1 city baselines are typical for complex healthcare assets and are reflected in the range.
      - **score**
          4
      - **explanation**
          Remote-site conditions, giga-project competition for labor/plant, and higher preliminaries lead to the highest $/ft² of the three locations despite port proximity. On a cost-per-square-foot basis alone, NEOM is the least favorable.
    - **location_3**
      - **data**
          Address: King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312, Saudi Arabia. Scope/assumptions: Acute general hospital, mid-to-high healthcare specification (building-only as defined), VAT excluded; Q3 2025 dollars. Indicative construction cost (Madinah market): 2,300–3,000 USD/m² (≈214–279 USD/ft²). Rationale and local factors: Madinah is a major western KSA city with established contractors and access to western ports (e.g., Yanbu ~170–200 km; Jeddah ~330–360 km), which supports competitive material logistics. Compared with Riyadh, the market is somewhat less overheated by giga‑project workloads, and logistics distances to ports are shorter, often yielding slightly lower tender pricing for comparable healthcare scope. Western KSA seismic design requirements can be higher than Riyadh but are generally offset by logistics advantages and market workload. National context remains as per contemporary benchmarks (Arcadis ICC 2024/2025; Turner & Townsend 2024/2025 Middle East), with hospitals carrying MEP‑intensive premiums over commercial builds; the stated range reflects recent western‑region tendering conditions for complex healthcare.
      - **score**
          8
      - **explanation**
          Among the three, Madinah typically offers the lowest hospital construction $/ft² due to balanced competition, strong western‑region logistics via Yanbu/Jeddah, and fewer giga‑project capacity constraints than NEOM or Riyadh. Thus it scores best on the cost-only criterion.
    - **overall_analysis**
        All three locations are globally competitive for healthcare build costs, but local market conditions and logistics materially affect $/ft². Indicative 2025 ranges: Madinah ≈214–279 USD/ft² (lowest), Riyadh ≈223–288 USD/ft² (mid), NEOM ≈269–372 USD/ft² (highest). These are building-only planning ranges for acute hospital projects and exclude land, fees, finance, VAT, and owner-supplied equipment. Rankings here consider only construction cost per square foot: Madinah (8/10), Riyadh (7/10), NEOM (4/10). If you proceed, commission a location-specific cost plan with geotech, utility availability, program detail, and market testing; final pricing can vary outside the ranges based on specification, procurement strategy, and timing.

National benchmark: physicians per 1,000 people ≈ 2.7 (World Bank, 2020). Riyadh Region contains the country’s highest concentration of physicians relative to population per Ministry of Health (MoH) Statistical Yearbooks, reflecting the clustering of major academic/tertiary centers (e.g., King Faisal Specialist & Research Centre, King Saud University Medical City, National Guard Health Affairs) and multiple medical colleges that feed the local workforce. Riyadh Region population (2022 Census) ≈ 8.6 million (GASTAT). These factors translate to the strongest practical physician availability in the Kingdom at the city/region level.

          Address is in NEOM (near Sharma) within Tabuk Region (northwest Saudi Arabia). National benchmark: physicians per 1,000 people ≈ 2.7 (World Bank, 2020). Tabuk Region is sparsely populated and more rural; MoH health indicators and yearbooks show lower physician concentration than large metropolitan regions (e.g., Riyadh/Makkah). NEOM’s on‑site resident population remains limited and evolving; current care footprint is developing, with reliance on recruitment from outside the region and referral pathways to Tabuk city or national centers. Tabuk Region population (2022 Census) ≈ 0.9–1.0 million (GASTAT).

          Address is in Madinah city within Madinah Region. National benchmark: physicians per 1,000 people ≈ 2.7 (World Bank, 2020). Madinah hosts major public and teaching hospitals (e.g., King Fahd Hospital, Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz Hospital) and Taibah University College of Medicine, supporting a moderate physician workforce. MoH statistical reports place Madinah around the national average for physician availability, below Riyadh but above several less‑populated regions. Madinah Region population (2022 Census) ≈ 2.3–2.5 million (GASTAT). Sources: World Bank SH.MED.PHYS.ZS; Saudi MoH Statistical Yearbook 2022; GASTAT 2022 Census (Madinah Region population).

Jurisdiction and regulators: Riyadh Municipality under MOMRAH (Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and Housing); citywide planning by the Royal Commission for Riyadh City (RCRC). Corridor context: King Abdulaziz Rd is a primary north–south arterial with established commercial/mixed‑use frontage and residential neighborhoods behind; health and public‑service uses are commonly sited on major corridors in north Riyadh (Al Aarid/Al Malqa/Al Thumama growth belt). Zoning/permissibility: Under MOMRAH municipal use classes and the Municipal Requirements for Healthcare Facilities, hospitals and clinics are permitted on commercial, mixed‑use, and public‑service plots (subject to plot size, setbacks, parking, access from a main road, and Civil Defense and MOH licensing). Utilities/access: Fully urbanized area with trunk utilities and multiple access options; arterial frontage supports ambulance access and traffic dispersion. Known overlays/constraints: No coastal/industrial hazard or protected‑area overlays; outside airport OLS critical zones; flood‑channel considerations are standard for Riyadh but no special overlay is indicated for this corridor. Approvals: Municipal land‑use confirmation via Balady GIS/permit; MOH facility license; Civil Defense; environmental and medical‑waste compliance; traffic impact study if required by RCRC/Riyadh Municipality. Note: Exact plot zoning must be verified on Balady and RCRC parcel data before application.

Jurisdiction and regulators: NEOM Authority (special economic zone) with its own planning, building, and environmental regulations; outside standard municipal regime. Area context: Coastal area within NEOM’s development footprint; land is subject to NEOM masterplans (e.g., designated community hubs, conservation areas, mobility corridors). Zoning/permissibility: Healthcare uses are planned within designated NEOM communities; ad‑hoc siting outside those nodes generally requires explicit NEOM land‑use allocation. Coastal protection and environmental regulations impose setbacks from the shoreline and require environmental impact assessment; sensitive habitats are present along this coast. Utilities/access: Many tracts remain under phased development; service availability and road hierarchy are masterplan‑dependent at this coordinate. Overlays/constraints: Coastal conservation policies, potential archeological/natural heritage constraints, and NEOM design code controls; aviation constraints possible if near NEOM Bay Airport flight paths; helipad approvals subject to GACA. Approvals: NEOM Permits & Licenses (planning consent, building permit), environmental approvals under NEOM Environmental Protection Regulations, MOH license for operation, Civil Defense.

Corridor context: King Abdullah Rd is a major urban arterial/ring corridor with mixed commercial/public‑service frontage in an established urban district. Zoning/permissibility: Hospitals and clinics are permitted municipal activities on commercial, mixed‑use, and public‑service plots per MOMRAH municipal requirements for healthcare facilities, subject to plot size, setbacks, parking, main‑road access, and MOH/Civil Defense approvals. Utilities/access: Urban services are present; arterial access supports ambulance ingress/egress. Overlays/constraints: Central Area around Al‑Masjid an‑Nabawi has height/traffic controls; Al Rayah is outside the immediate Central Area but corridor‑level traffic management and any local height controls may apply. Approvals: Land‑use confirmation via Balady GIS/permit, MOH license, Civil Defense, traffic impact assessment if triggered by scale.
      - **score**

          Generally favorable municipal context for hospital use on a major corridor with established mixed uses. Residual risk stems from plot‑specific designation, corridor traffic/parking standards, and any proximity‑based controls related to the broader Central Area policies.
    - **overall_analysis**
        All three sites can potentially host a hospital, but zoning/entitlement certainty varies. Riyadh (Al Aarid, King Abdulaziz Rd) offers the clearest by‑policy pathway on an arterial commonly hosting public‑service uses (score 8/10). Madinah (King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah) is also favorable, with typical municipal permissions and standard corridor controls (7/10). NEOM (Sharma) is most uncertain because land use is tightly governed by NEOM’s masterplans and coastal/environmental protections; compliance depends on being within a designated healthcare/service node (5/10). In all cases, confirm the specific parcel’s current land‑use designation on Balady (or NEOM’s permitting system) before proceeding.

      - **data**
          - Setting: Inland urban district (Al Aarid) in northern Riyadh on the Najd plateau; elevation roughly 600–700 m above sea level; arid built-up surroundings with major arterials (King Abdulaziz Rd); King Khalid International Airport is roughly 20–25 km away (potential flight-path noise depending on runway use). - Climate: Hot desert (BWh). National Center for Meteorology (Saudi NCM) normals indicate very hot summers (average July/August max ~43–45°C) and mild winters; low annual rainfall (~90–110 mm), concentrated November–April with episodic convective downpours that can produce flash floods. - Air quality and dust: Frequently degraded by dust/sandstorms driven by shamal winds (most common in spring). Independent monitoring (e.g., IQAir World Air Quality reports) show annual PM2.5 well above WHO guideline (5 µg/m³), commonly exceeding 50 µg/m³ in recent years; multiple dusty days per year (on the order of several dozen) are typical for Riyadh according to regional dust climatology studies. - Flood/flash-flood hazard: Riyadh has a network of wadis (e.g., Wadi Hanifah and tributaries). Urban flash flooding has been documented in heavy-rain events (civil defense/NCM advisories; notable events in 2013 and 2018–2019), with localized roadway and underpass flooding; the Al Aarid area includes engineered stormwater infrastructure but remains exposed to short-duration, high-intensity rainfall. - Seismic/tectonic hazard: Very low compared with western Saudi Arabia. Saudi Geological Survey (SGS) seismic hazard maps classify the Riyadh region in a low peak ground acceleration zone (on the order of <0.04 g for 10% probability of exceedance in 50 years). No tsunami exposure (inland). - Heat stress/urban microclimate: Strong urban heat island, extreme summer heat, and high radiant load increase building cooling and outdoor thermal stress. - Other environmental considerations: No nearby heavy industry clusters in the immediate Al Aarid vicinity; traffic emissions and construction dust are main local contributors; no sea-level rise exposure.
      - **score**
          7
      - **explanation**
          Strengths: very low seismic hazard and no coastal/tsunami exposure; absence of heavy industry nearby. Main environmental risks are extreme heat, frequent dust/sandstorms with poor PM2.5 air quality, and episodic urban flash flooding from short, intense rain events. With robust building envelope/HVAC filtration, shading, and stormwater design, risks are manageable—hence above-average suitability but not top-tier due to chronic air quality and heat.
    - **location_2**
      - **data**
          - Setting: Coastal site near Sharma in the NEOM development area on the Gulf of Aqaba/Red Sea coast; elevation ~0–50 m on a narrow coastal plain backed by steep mountains and wadis draining to the sea; sensitive marine and coral reef environments offshore. - Climate: Hot arid maritime. Summers are very warm but typically a few degrees milder than interior cities (typical summer highs ~36–40°C) with higher humidity; annual rainfall is very low (~10–40 mm) but can occur in short, intense events, especially in cooler seasons, with orographic enhancement over nearby mountains. - Air quality and dust: Baseline anthropogenic pollution is relatively low compared to major cities; PM2.5 annual means are generally lower (often ~15–35 µg/m³) but still above WHO guideline due to regional dust; episodic dust/sand intrusions occur under northerly shamal and synoptic disturbances. - Flood/flash-flood hazard: Pronounced risk of short-notice flash flooding where wadis debouch from the escarpment across the coastal plain; siting away from active wadi channels and ensuring elevated platforms/drainage conveyance is critical. - Seismic/tectonic and tsunami hazard: Moderate seismic hazard due to proximity to the Gulf of Aqaba–Dead Sea Transform and Red Sea rift. SGS hazard mapping places the far northwest in a higher zone than central Saudi (on the order of ~0.1–0.2 g PGA for 10% in 50 years). The Mw 7.2 Gulf of Aqaba earthquake (1995) generated localized tsunami/wave effects observed around Eilat/Aqaba; while the Red Sea micro-tidal range limits surge, coastal facilities should consider tsunami/storm wave setback and vertical evacuation. - Sea-level rise/coastal flooding: Exposed to long-term sea-level rise and coastal inundation; design freeboards and setbacks are required under mid- to late-century scenarios (IPCC-consistent planning: ~0.5–1.0 m global mean SLR by 2100 under higher emissions, with local variation). - Other environmental considerations: Strong coastal winds; corrosion potential from marine aerosols; proximity to protected marine habitats and wildlife corridors implies more stringent environmental permitting and construction controls.
      - **score**
          6
      - **explanation**
          Strengths: comparatively cleaner air and slightly milder temperatures than interior sites; good ventilation from coastal winds. Key environmental risks that lower suitability are: moderate seismicity with credible tsunami potential, flash-flooding from steep wadis, and direct coastal exposure to storm waves and sea-level rise. With rigorous seismic/tsunami design criteria, coastal set-back/elevation, and flood routing, risks are manageable but higher than inland low-seismic alternatives.
    - **location_3**
      - **data**
          - Setting: Urban corridor along King Abdullah Rd in Al Rayah, Madinah; inland basin surrounded by volcanic basalt fields (Harrat Rahat) and hills; elevation roughly ~600–650 m. - Climate: Hot desert (BWh). Very hot summers (average July/August max ~43–44°C); low annual rainfall (~30–60 mm) concentrated in cooler months; convective storms can produce intense short-duration rainfall. - Air quality and dust: PM2.5 typically above WHO guideline but generally lower than Riyadh’s heavy urban levels (often ~30–50 µg/m³ annually), with episodic dust events. - Flood/flash-flood hazard: Presence of wadis (e.g., Wadi Al-Aqeeq and tributaries) traversing the metropolitan area; recent NCM/civil defense advisories and documented events have produced urban flooding and road closures in heavy rains. - Seismic/tectonic and volcanic hazard: Western Saudi Arabia has higher seismic hazard than the interior; SGS maps place Madinah in a moderate zone (roughly ~0.08–0.16 g PGA for 10% in 50 years) due to proximity to the Red Sea rift and local structures. Madinah is adjacent to the Harrat Rahat volcanic field; the last eruption in 1256 CE produced lava flows that approached the city—implying a low-probability but credible long-term volcanic hazard, along with potential volcanic/seismic swarms. - Other environmental considerations: No tsunami or sea-level rise exposure (inland); airport located to the northeast (potential flight-path noise depending on approach), traffic emissions along the corridor, and pronounced summer heat stress.
      - **score**
          5
      - **explanation**
          Strengths: no coastal/tsunami exposure; air quality often better than Riyadh. However, environmental risk is elevated by the combination of moderate seismic hazard, a documented (though low-frequency) volcanic field adjacent to the city, and recurrent flash-flooding in wadi corridors, plus extreme heat. These factors collectively lower suitability relative to low-seismic inland alternatives.
    - **overall_analysis**
        For environmental risk alone (natural hazards, climate/air, and site-exposure factors): Riyadh (Al Aarid) ranks highest due to very low seismic risk and no coastal exposure, but its chronic heat/dust/PM2.5 and episodic flash floods keep it from a top score. NEOM (Sharma) benefits from cleaner air and slightly milder heat but faces materially higher seismic/tsunami and coastal/flash-flood exposures that require stringent siting and design. Madinah contends with moderate seismicity, a low-frequency volcanic hazard (Harrat Rahat), and wadi flash-flooding in addition to extreme heat, yielding the lowest score among the three. Robust hazard-aware siting (avoiding wadis/coastal lowlands), conservative structural and flood design, elevated/armored critical infrastructure, and high-spec HVAC filtration are key mitigations across all sites.

          Riyadh (Al Aarid district, King Abdulaziz Rd, 13331) sits on the Arabian Peninsula's interior plateau, far from active plate boundaries. Key natural-hazard facts:
- Earthquake: Very low seismicity relative to the Kingdom; national and global seismic hazard maps place Riyadh in one of Saudi Arabia’s lowest shaking zones (typical 475-year PGA well below ~0.05 g). [Sources: Saudi Geological Survey (SGS) national seismic hazard mapping; Global Earthquake Model (GEM) seismic hazard mosaic]
- Flood/flash flood: Periodic heavy convective storms can trigger urban/flash flooding along wadis (e.g., events in 2018 and 2023 led to roadway flooding and temporary closures). City is crossed by Wadi Hanifa and tributaries, with known surface-water concentration points. [Sources: Saudi civil defense and media reports; municipal drainage studies]
- Sand/dust storms: Frequent Shamal winds cause dust storms and reduced visibility several times per year; impacts are operational (air quality, power/air intake management) rather than structural. [Sources: WMO/WHO regional dust reports]
- Extreme heat: Prolonged heatwaves are common; summer daytime highs often exceed 45°C, raising cooling and power-reliability design demands. [Sources: Saudi National Center for Meteorology climatology]
- No tsunami or tropical cyclone exposure (inland); no volcanic hazard.
      - **score**
          8
      - **explanation**
          Riyadh’s structural disaster risk is comparatively low: minimal seismicity and no tsunami/volcanic/cyclone exposure. Residual risks are mainly flash flooding, extreme heat, and dust, which can be mitigated through siting (away from wadis), robust drainage, cooling and filtration redundancy, and emergency power design. These manageable hazards keep the score high but not perfect.
    - **location_2**
      - **data**
          NEOM/Sharma area (269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, Tabuk Region) lies on the Red Sea/Gulf of Aqaba coast near the Dead Sea Transform and Gulf of Aqaba rift system. Key natural-hazard facts:
- Earthquake: Elevated seismic hazard for Saudi Arabia due to proximity to active faults; the 1995 Gulf of Aqaba (Nuweiba) earthquake reached Mw ~7.2 and produced strong regional shaking. Future M6–7 events are plausible in this tectonic setting. [Sources: USGS summary of the 1995 Aqaba event; regional seismotectonic studies]
- Tsunami: Low-probability but credible near-field tsunami potential in the Gulf of Aqaba/Red Sea from seismic sources or submarine slope failures; small amplitudes were documented after the 1995 event. Coastal siting warrants elevation and setback. [Sources: IOC-UNESCO/USGS regional tsunami assessments]
- Flood/flash flood: Coastal wadis descending from the escarpment can generate short-notice flash floods after intense rain. [Sources: GFDRR ThinkHazard regional screening; Saudi civil defense bulletins]
- Sea-level rise/coastal hazards: Long-term sea-level rise and storm setup/surge in the Red Sea (generally modest versus open oceans) still require freeboard and coastal protection for critical facilities. [Sources: IPCC AR6 regional sea-level projections]
- Heat and dust: Hot arid climate with marine moderation compared with inland cities; dust storms occur seasonally. [Sources: Saudi NCM; WMO]
      - **score**
          5
      - **explanation**
          Seismic risk is the dominant concern, with credible strong shaking scenarios that drive stringent structural and nonstructural resilience needs. Additive coastal hazards (low-probability tsunami, SLR, flash floods in coastal wadis) further complicate site design and emergency access. While all are engineerable, the aggregate natural-disaster exposure is materially higher than inland alternatives, lowering the score.

      - **data**
          Madinah (King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, 42312) lies on the Hejaz margin near extensive Holocene basaltic volcanic fields (Harrat). Key natural-hazard facts:
- Volcanic: The Harrat Rahat volcanic field directly south of Madinah last erupted in 1256 CE, with lava flows advancing to within roughly 4 km of the city. The field remains potentially active and is monitored; probability is low on an annual basis but non-zero on planning horizons. [Sources: Saudi Geological Survey volcano monitoring; peer-reviewed summaries of the 1256 eruption]
- Earthquake: Moderate regional seismicity from the Red Sea rift/transform system and harrat-related crustal processes; notable unrest includes the 2009 Harrat Lunayyir swarm (M 5.4 main event) NW of Madinah. [Sources: USGS; SGS]
- Flood/flash flood: Orography and lava-flow topography can channel intense rainfall into rapid runoff and wadi flooding within the city. Events with damaging urban flooding have been recorded in the last two decades. [Sources: GFDRR ThinkHazard screening; municipal incident reports]
- Heat and dust: Hot arid climate with frequent summer heatwaves and seasonal dust. [Sources: Saudi NCM]
      - **score**
          6
      - **explanation**
          Compared with Riyadh, Madinah adds two natural perils of greater consequence: moderate seismicity and proximity to an historically active volcanic field. While the likelihood of a new eruption is low, its potential impact is severe and must be planned for. Flash-flood and heat/dust risks are manageable but real. Overall risk is moderate, warranting robust site selection, structural design, and multi-hazard emergency planning.
    - **overall_analysis**
        For natural-disaster risk alone, Riyadh (8/10) is the most favorable, driven by very low seismicity and absence of coastal/volcanic hazards; remaining risks (flash floods, heat, dust) are largely mitigable. Madinah (6/10) has additional moderate seismic and low-probability volcanic hazards that increase consequence severity despite low annual likelihood. NEOM/Sharma (5/10) faces the highest combination of earthquake and coastal hazards (including low-probability tsunami and SLR) plus flash-flood potential, requiring the most stringent multi-hazard design and site-risk mitigation.

**Number of competing hospitals within 10km**

## RIYADH SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Location: King Abdulaziz Rd, Al Aarid, Riyadh 13331 (northern Riyadh). Within approximately 10 km, there are numerous hospitals and large specialty centers serving northern and central Riyadh. Notable facilities commonly mapped within this catchment include: King Abdullah Specialist Children’s Hospital (King Abdulaziz Medical City – National Guard, approx. 10 km SE), King Fahad Medical City (central Riyadh, ~10 km S), King Saud University Medical City/King Khalid University Hospital (Al Muruj/Al Nada corridor, ~7–10 km SW), Security Forces Hospital (Olaya/Al Murabba area, ~10–12 km S), Dr. Sulaiman Al Habib Hospital (various branches; e.g., Al Ghadir/King Abdullah Financial District proximity ~6–9 km), Specialized Medical Center (~10 km S), Saudi German Hospital Riyadh (Al Sahafa ~4–6 km), and several private hospitals such as Kingdom Hospital (Al Aqiq ~6–8 km), Al Hammadi Hospital Al Suwaidi/Olaya branches (~9–11 km), Dr. Sulaiman Al Habib Hospital Takhassusi (~10–11 km), and multiple day-surgery/specialty centers. Conservatively, 12–18 full-service hospitals fall within a 10 km radius, with a higher count if including specialty and private general hospitals.
- **Score:** 2/10
- **Explanation:** Competition is very high in northern Riyadh within 10 km, including multiple tertiary/quaternary centers and large private hospital systems. While demand in Riyadh is strong, the specific criterion (number of competing hospitals within 10 km) makes this location relatively less favorable.

## NEOM SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Location: 269J+WJ, Sharma 49626, NEOM, Saudi Arabia (northwestern Tabuk Province on the Red Sea coast). The area is sparsely populated and under active development for NEOM projects. Within a 10 km radius of Sharma/NEOM Hotel/airport corridor, there are currently no mapped full-service general hospitals; healthcare presence consists of clinics/medical centers serving construction and resident staff. The nearest established hospitals are typically far outside 10 km, e.g., hospitals in Duba (~45–60 km by road) or Tabuk city (~150–170 km).
- **Score:** 10/10
- **Explanation:** There are effectively zero competing hospitals within 10 km. From the competition-only perspective, this is the best of the three. Note: overall feasibility depends on NEOM’s phased population and infrastructure growth, but competition in the 10 km radius is minimal.

## MEDINA SAUDI ARBIA
- **Data:** Location: King Abdullah Rd, Al Rayah, Madinah 42312. Within a 10 km radius in Medina, major hospitals include: King Fahd Hospital (Prince Naif Rd), Ohud Hospital (near the ring road), King Salman Medical City (under development; tertiary complex), Al Aziziyah General Hospital, Maternity and Children’s Hospital (MCH), Saudi German Hospital Madinah (Al Madinah–Yanbu Rd), International Medical Center (IMC) Madinah branch, and several private hospitals (e.g., Al Dar, Al Ansar near the Prophet’s Mosque area is more specialty/urgent). A realistic count of full-service hospitals within 10 km is approximately 6–10, depending on inclusion of specialty and military facilities.
- **Score:** 4/10
- **Explanation:** Medina has a moderate-to-high density of hospitals within 10 km of the specified address, including large public and private institutions, resulting in notable competition. It is less saturated than central Riyadh but significantly more competitive than NEOM/Sharma.

## Overall Analysis
By the single criterion of competing hospitals within 10 km, NEOM/Sharma is optimal (no direct competitors). Medina has moderate competition, and northern Riyadh has heavy competition from multiple tertiary and private hospitals. Scores reflect competition only, not market demand, access, regulation, workforce, or payer mix.

# Research Results for Criterion:

**Population density (people per sq km)**

## RIYADH SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** Riyadh (Al Aarid district, King Abdulaziz Rd, 13331) sits in northern Riyadh within a rapidly urbanizing corridor. City-level density benchmarks: Riyadh Province overall ~17 persons/km² (broad region), but Riyadh city’s urban density is much higher. Published estimates for Riyadh city density range around 4,000–5,000 persons/km² based on a population of approximately 7.5–8.0 million and an urbanized area on the order of 1,500–1,800 km². Northern districts like Al Aarid are experiencing intense residential development with mid-rise housing and villas, leading to local densities that are at or approaching typical Riyadh urban averages. In short, the immediate catchment is high-density by Saudi standards, with continued growth trends.
- **Score:** 9/10
- **Explanation:** High and growing population density in northern Riyadh makes this location favorable for hospital placement. Urbanized fabric and residential expansion support strong immediate and near-term demand. The only reason not to assign 10/10 is that some peripheral northern tracts are still filling in compared to Riyadh’s most established central districts.

## NEOM SAUDI ARABIA
- **Data:** NEOM (Sharma area, 269J+WJ) lies on the Red Sea coast in Tabuk Region. Current on-the-ground population density is very low: Sharma and surrounding coastal settlements are sparse, characterized by desert/coastal terrain with small towns and workforce compounds. While NEOM’s long-term plan targets a very large population, today’s realized residential footprint is limited, making current population density in the immediate vicinity extremely low (orders of magnitude below 1,000 persons/km²; more consistent with rural densities).
- **Score:** 2/10
- **Explanation:** Current population density is very low, which limits immediate hospital demand. Future master plans suggest growth potential, but on present-day density alone (the stated criterion), this site underperforms compared to major cities.

## MEDINA SAUDI ARBIA
- **Data:** Medina (Al Rayah district, King Abdullah Rd, 42312) is within the Madinah urban area. Madinah city’s population is roughly 1.3–1.6 million, with an urban area that yields densities typically in the mid-thousands persons/km², lower than Riyadh’s most built-up zones but still substantially urban. Districts along King Abdullah Rd host mixed residential/commercial development; population density in these central-to-inner suburban areas is solidly urban and seasonally augmented by pilgrim influxes (although transient populations are not counted in standard density).
- **Score:** 7/10
- **Explanation:** Madinah offers meaningful urban population density supportive of a hospital catchment, but average densities are somewhat lower than Riyadh’s highest-density corridors. Seasonal surges increase service needs, yet the core criterion here is resident density, which is moderate-to-high rather than very high.

## Overall Analysis
On the criterion of population density alone: Riyadh (Al Aarid) ranks highest due to substantial and growing urban density; Madinah (Al Rayah) is strong but somewhat less dense on average; NEOM (Sharma) remains low-density at present despite long-term development plans.
